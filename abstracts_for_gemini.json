By Kehlet H. Br J Anaesth 1997; 78:606-17 Major surgery is still associated with undesirable sequelae such as pain, cardiopulmonary, infective and thromboembolic complications, cerebral dysfunction, nausea and gastrointestinal paralysis, fatigue, and prolonged convalescence. The key pathogenic factor in postoperative morbidity, excluding failures of surgical and anesthetic technique, is the surgical stress response with subsequent increased demands on organ function. These changes in organ function are thought to be mediated by trauma-induced endocrine metabolic changes and activation of several biologic cascade systems (cytokines, complement, arachidonic acid metabolites, nitric oxide, free oxygen radicals, among others). To understand postoperative morbidity, it is therefore necessary to understand the pathophysiologic role of the various components of the surgical stress response and to determine whether modification of such responses may improve surgical outcome. While no single technique or drug regimen has been shown to eliminate postoperative morbidity and mortality, multimodal interventions may lead to a major reduction in the undesirable sequelae of surgical injury with improved recovery and reduction in postoperative morbidity and overall costs.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40626746\/"},{"pmid":40626745,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"Three Years On: The Impact of the Dobbs Decision on Anesthesia Practice.","authors":"Gambling DR; Vogel TM; Markley JC; Traynor AJ; Cohn JH; Morgan CL","abstract":"Many individuals seeking abortion care since the Dobbs decision present at later gestations and with comorbidities.

Using detailed LTU criteria, this study aimed to construct a multistate model of peritraumatic opioid use and elucidate reasons for posttraumatic LTU. METHODS: This population-based cohort study links data from the 2015-2018 cohorts in the Norwegian Trauma Registry (n=24 224) with outpatient medication prescription records from the Norwegian Prescription Database for 1 yr before and 2 yr after injury. LTU was assigned upon receiving >\/=900 morphine milligram equivalents within 90 days and another opioid prescription 91-180 days after any initial prescription; it ended after 180 days without opioid prescriptions, emigration, or death. Prescriptions to patients with LTU in the year after injury were screened for chronic pain and palliative care reimbursement codes, and for opioid maintenance treatment preparations. RESULTS: Posttraumatic opioid prescriptions primarily increased as a result of short-term opioid use (STU), peaking at 38.2% and returning to pre-injury levels (5.4%) within 6 months. Increases in LTU were smaller (4.3% to 6.7%). Among patients with LTU in the year after injury (n=1946), 47.4% exhibited LTU and 18.3% STU in the 6 months pre-injury. Moreover, 36.0% were reimbursed for chronic pain medications, 5.9% for palliative care, and 13.1% received opioid maintenance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, most patients with posttraumatic long-term opioid use had used opioids before injury, underscoring the need to address such use to minimise posttraumatic long-term opioid use. Few patients with long-term opioid use received palliative care or opioid maintenance treatment, indicating subacute and chronic pain as primary indications. As long-term opioid use for pain is highly controversial, findings emphasise a need for effective nonopioid alternatives.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40615331\/"},{"pmid":40571477,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Frailty and perioperative outcomes: SNAP-3 as a call to action.","authors":"McIsaac DI; Amado L","abstract":"Generalisable, prospectively collected data from 7800 older UK surgical patients in the 3(rd) Sprint National Anesthesia Project (SNAP-3) confirm that the presence of frailty is a key risk factor for adverse outcomes among older surgical patients.

The investigators identified frailty in one-fifth of patients using multiple tools, including the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Frailty was especially prevalent in emergency surgery and socioeconomically deprived populations. Multimorbidity was present in two-thirds of patients but only partially overlapped with frailty. Frailty was strongly associated with increased length of stay, delirium, complications, and mortality, with adverse outcomes escalating with higher CFS scores. In contrast, multimorbidity (without frailty) had limited association with most adverse outcomes. Directed acyclic graphs guided causal analysis, but by assuming frailty and multimorbidity were independent, the investigators might have underestimated the impact of multimorbidity. SNAP-3 highlights the need for routine perioperative frailty screening, comprehensive perioperative services, and workforce development.

We evaluated the environmental and economic impacts of currently available patient warming methods. METHODS: We conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) of three active warming devices (forced air warmer, resistive blanket, and circulating water garment) using a functional unit of 1 h of active patient warming. Passive warming was investigated using a singular LCA and LCC of warmed flannel blankets, with the functional unit defined as the use of one warmed flannel blanket. These results were applied to eight clinical scenarios modelling different combinations of warming devices within perioperative settings. We used multicriteria decision analysis to aggregate environmental and financial impacts into sustainability indexes. RESULTS: The resistive blanket had the lowest environmental and economic impacts. The global warming potential and cumulative energy demand of the resistive blanket were <7% and 25%, respectively, of the impacts assessed for the forced air warmer. The most sustainable patient warming pathway used the resistive blanket throughout the perioperative period. Clinical scenarios using flannel blankets before and after surgery entailed the highest environmental impacts, and the highest cost was incurred with the circulating water garment. CONCLUSIONS: The environmental and economic sustainability of perioperative patient warming can be optimised by minimising flannel blankets and disposable consumables in the perioperative period and by using the resistive blanket for active warming. This study presents a novel multicriteria sustainability index and simulates clinically relevant scenarios to inform practical, evidence-based recommendations for sustainable patient warming.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40541484\/"},{"pmid":40533323,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Cortical integration and control of spontaneous neuropathic pain-like behaviour in mice.","authors":"Li Z; Huang X; Ma J; Liu Q; Chen L; Liu X; Qin Q; Yang H; Han R; Li K; Hu R; Yan X; Huang Y; Huang D; Zhou H","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Spontaneous pain is commonly reported in patients with nerve injuries, posing a great challenge to physicians. However, the mechanisms underlying spontaneous pain remain largely unknown in comparison to evoked pain (e.g. allodynia and hyperalgesia). Cortical processing is vital in coding nociception, and dysfunction of anterior cingulate cortex might facilitate pain hypersensitivity. This indicates a distinct pattern of ensemble activity during spontaneous pain-like behaviour. METHODS: Combining in vivo calcium imaging and ex vivo electrophysiological recording, we explored the maladaptive changes of cortical neurones at individual and population levels induced by several models of neuropathic pain in mice. We also examined the role of the anterior cingulate cortex in the regulation of spontaneous pain-like behaviour using optogenetic methods. RESULTS: We identified a common status of cortical hyperactivity in pyramidal neurones and neural ensembles recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex. Optogenetic inhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex inhibited spontaneous pain-like behaviour, while optogenetic activation restored it. In addition, the cortical representation of spontaneous behaviour was inhibited by nerve injury, which conversely was restored with pain relief. In freely moving animals, we further demonstrated a stable mode of cortical integration in response to spontaneous grooming episodes, independent of the presence of pain, with a dynamic reconfiguration mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal an essential role of the anterior cingulate cortex in the processing and modulation of non-evoked reflex in distinct preclinical models of neuropathic pain in mice.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40533323\/"},{"pmid":40526440,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"Pediatric Regional Anesthesia: A Practical Guideline for Daily Clinical Practice.","authors":"Marhofer P; Zadrazil M; Opfermann PL","abstract":"The past two decades have seen remarkable progress in pediatric regional anesthesia.

However, the optimal single-shot regional anaesthesia modality remains unclear. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to May 5, 2024. Randomised controlled trials comparing various single-shot regional anaesthesia modalities were included. Frequentist and component network meta-analyses were performed. The primary outcomes included static and dynamic pain (visual analogue scale [VAS]) at 6 and 12 h after operation and total morphine consumption at 24 h. Additional outcomes included opioid-related adverse effects, patient satisfaction, quality of recovery, and postoperative lower limb muscle power. RESULTS: Eighty-seven randomised controlled trials were included. In static VAS, femoral nerve block ranked best (surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA)=92.8%), followed by lumbar plexus block (LPB) plus local infiltrative analgesia (LIA) (SUCRA=85.7%) at 6 h after operation. At 12 h after operation, LPB plus LIA was top ranked (SUCRA=89.2%), followed by quadratus lumborum block plus fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) (SUCRA=84.8%). In dynamic VAS, pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block plus LIA (SUCRA=86.3%) and LPB plus LIA (SUCRA=83.4%) ranked best at 6 and 12 h after operation, respectively.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which general anaesthetics contribute to PND remain largely unknown. Based on our findings of a link between hyperhomocysteinaemia and increased risk of PND, we investigated functional alterations in cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and its role in memory function after general anaesthesia. METHODS: Mice were subjected to isoflurane 1.4 vol% anaesthesia for 2 h, and the levels of homocysteine, homocysteine-associated enzyme expression, and CBS activity were measured using ELISA. The time course of memory reconstruction after general anaesthesia was evaluated using the contextual fear conditioning test. WaterLOGSY was used to examine the interaction between isoflurane and CBS. A hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) probe, AZ-NO(2), was used for H(2)S bioimaging, and RNA sequencing, sulfhydrome detection, and in vivo electrophysiological recordings were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: The decline in cognitive function persisted for at least 8 h after isoflurane anaesthesia, which is attributed to the selective homocysteine accumulation in the brain via direct inhibition of CBS activity by isoflurane. Activation of CBS alleviates the reduction of H(2)S and alters the sulfhydration of synaptic-related proteins, ultimately accelerating the restoration of neuronal firing rates in the hippocampus (saline, 1.42 [0.49] vs NaHS, 2.45 [0.68] Hz). Pretreatment with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM, CBS activator) could increase the freezing time of mice after isoflurane anaesthesia (control 4.86 [3.30]% vs SAM, 9.89 [3.03]%). CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane contributes to delayed cognitive recovery after isoflurane anaesthesia in mice by directly inhibiting CBS activity, providing novel insights into the involvement of isoflurane in PNDs and their underlying mechanisms.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40483182\/"},{"pmid":40480916,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Patterns of prevention effectiveness in postoperative neurocognitive disorder and delayed neurocognitive recovery research: a systematic review with meta-regression of randomised trials.","authors":"Lahiri NK; Vuckovic N; Sidhu AS; Li J; Sun Y; Naiken S; Curtis SJ; Bisch E; Bolda R; Nagra PS; Mann G; Gonzales AE; Smith L; Anderson BP; Liu Z; Adams DC; Meng L","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Postoperative neurocognitive disorder and delayed neurocognitive recovery (pNCD\/dNCR) are common yet unresolved complications after surgery.

This study investigated whether plasma growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) concentrations were associated with PONV in at-risk adult patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: Patients (n = 896) from a previous randomised controlled trial were included. Blood samples were collected before surgery in the pre-anaesthesia room and at the end of surgery. Plasma GDF-15 concentrations were measured using the Human GDF-15 ELISA Kit. The primary outcome was PONV, defined as nausea, retching, or vomiting, within 120 h after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 860 (96.0%) of patients were female. During 0-120 h after surgery, 531 (59.3%) patients experienced PONV. Unadjusted logistic models showed negative associations between preoperative and postoperative GDF-15 concentrations and PONV, but this association was not significant for postoperative concentrations after adjustment for confounders including preoperative concentrations. Compared with the first tertile of preoperative GDF-15 concentrations, the second tertile had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44-0.91; P=0.013), and the third tertile had an aOR of 0.44 (95% CI 0.30-0.64; P<0.001) for PONV. Restricted cubic splines showed that PONV odds decreased rapidly until the preoperative GDF-15 concentrations were 830.36 pg ml(-1) and then plateaued (P for overall <0.001, P for non-linearity=0.002). Compared with a low-maintaining trajectory, a high-increasing trajectory had an aOR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.46-0.89; P=0.008) for PONV. CONCLUSIONS: Lower preoperative plasma GDF-15 concentrations or low-maintaining trajectory were associated with higher odds of PONV in laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery patients.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40441987\/"},{"pmid":40410097,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Sex-specific genetics underlie increased chronic pain risk in women: genome-wide association studies from the UK Biobank.","authors":"Parisien M; Fillingim M; Tanguay-Sabourin C; Roy M; Vachon-Presseau E; Diatchenko L","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain disproportionately affects women, but the reasons for this disparity are unclear. METHODS: We investigated this disparity from a genetic perspective using data from the UK Biobank, focusing on multisite chronic pain, which is highly heritable and manifests a sex bias. RESULTS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that women have approximately 4500 sex-specific causal loci for overlapping pains, four times more than men, accounting for their higher heritability. Heritability partitioning indicated that pain-related loci are primarily enriched in specific brain regions, but only in women. Additionally, 200 imaging-derived brain phenotypes were significantly associated with pain in women, compared with only six in men. GWAS of these brain phenotypes showed stronger genetic correlations with pain in women, particularly regarding cortical thickness and striatal volume. When disentangling pleiotropy from causation in genetically correlated pairs of brain- and pain-related traits, we found that the genetics of brain phenotypes are more often causally implicated with the presence of chronic pain in women. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetics play a crucial role in the increased risk of chronic pain observed in women.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40410097\/"},{"pmid":40404500,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Association of non-anaemic iron deficiency with postoperative outcomes after fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty: a prospective cohort study.","authors":"Jorgensen CC; Lindberg-Larsen M; Gromov K; Varnum C; Bider MJ; Overgaard S; Andersen MR; Hansen TB; Kehlet H","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Preoperative iron deficiency anaemia is a common risk factor for worse postoperative outcomes. However, the influence of preoperative iron deficiency without anaemia on postoperative outcomes after hip and knee arthroplasty is uncertain. METHODS: We used the Fast-track Center for Hip and Knee Replacement Database registry from eight Danish departments for this prospective cohort study. Anaemia and iron deficiency were defined as haemoglobin of <130 g L(-1) and transferrin saturation <20%, respectively. Patient characteristics were collected using patient-reported questionnaires and information on prescribed medication, laboratory results and follow-up using electronic healthcare records. Quantile regression was used to analyse changes in median days alive and at home at postoperative day 30 (DAH(30)) and day 90 (DAH(90)), adjusting for procedure, hospital, and comorbidity. Additional endpoints included length of hospital stay >2 days, 30-day readmission rate, and self-evaluated health (EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale [EQ-VAS]) at 90 days. RESULTS: The cohort included 964 iron deficient and 3919 iron replete participants undergoing primary unilateral hip or knee arthroplasty. Median DAH(30) was 29.0 (interquartile range 29.0-30.0) days in both groups, but differently distributed (P<0.001). Adjusted difference in median DAH was -0.00 (95% confidence interval -0.00 to -0.00; P=0.001) and -0.00 (95% confidence interval -0.00 to -0.00; P=0.006) days for DAH(30) and DAH(90), respectively. There was no association between iron deficiency and any of the other endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of iron deficiency on days alive and at home at 30 and 90 days after fast-track hip or knee arthroplasty was statistically significant, but of minimal clinical importance.

Our previous findings revealed that the interactions between spinal microglia and astrocytes are crucial for burn-induced pain hypersensitivity. However, the mechanisms underlying burn-induced peripheral sensitisation remain incompletely understood. METHODS: Sensory neurone-satellite glial cell (SGC) interactions within peripheral dorsal root ganglia were investigated using in vitro and in vivo experiments. Behavioural tests were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting peripheral sensitisation mechanisms for burn pain management. RESULTS: Burn injury upregulated calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression in sensory neurones (1.5-fold; P=0.013) through transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels. Pharmacological blockade of the TRPV1\/CGRP signalling pathway effectively attenuated burn-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Additionally, neurone-derived CGRP triggered SGC activation (from 6.8% pre-injury to 41.6% at day 5 post-injury), concomitant with enhanced gap junction-mediated SGC coupling (from 16.7% pre-injury to 40.5% at day 5 post-injury). Furthermore, chemokine expression (particularly CXCL1) in SGCs was elevated after burn injury, which potentiated sensory neurone excitability and exacerbated pain hypersensitivity. Blocking SGC coupling exerted potent analgesic effects in this burn pain model. CONCLUSIONS: A novel neurone-SGC interaction mechanism drives burn-induced peripheral sensitisation, providing translational implications for burn pain therapeutics.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40404497\/"},{"pmid":40384317,"journal":"European journal of anaesthesiology","title":"Long-term and pre-operative benzodiazepine use in older adults and risk for postoperative delirium: An additional analysis of the multicentre Biomarker Development for Postoperative Cognitive Impairment in the Elderly Study.","authors":"Starks SCE; Pohrt A; Halzl-Yurek F; Heinrich M; Muller A; Spies CD; Winterer G; Zacharias N","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common acute neurocognitive disorder characterised by sudden changes in mental status, including altered alertness, consciousness and cognition, and usually occurs in elderly patients. There is an urgent need to identify predictors of POD to prevent its onset, as it can significantly delay recovery from surgery. Benzodiazepines are among the most frequently prescribed medications, particularly for female individuals. They have a depressant effect on the central nervous system and are used to treat sleep disorders, anxiety, muscle relaxation and epilepsy. However, benzodiazepines may increase the risk of POD. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether long-term benzodiazepine use, premedication and the interaction of benzodiazepines with sex are associated with the occurrence of POD and postoperative neurocognitive ability. DESIGN: A part analysis of the prospective multicentre BioCog cohort study. SETTING: Two-centre study conducted at Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin (Germany) and University Hospital Utrecht (Netherlands), both primary care hospitals, between October 2014 and September 2019. PATIENTS: Data from 928 patients from the BioCog cohort study who underwent elective surgery were analysed. Of these, 42.3% were women, 18.6% reported long-term benzodiazepine use and 12.4% received premedication with benzodiazepines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We studied the association of benzodiazepine use on cognition and the development of POD. We found that the timing of benzodiazepine use was crucial. RESULTS: Long-term benzodiazepine use was significantly associated with the risk of developing POD, independent of sex ( P  < 0.001). In contrast, premedication with benzodiazepines immediately before surgery was not associated with the risk of POD ( P  = 0.242). males and females developed POD at similar rates. Regardless of sex, long-term benzodiazepine use elevated the risk of POD, unlike premedication with benzodiazepines. CONCLUSION: Long-term use of benzodiazepines is associated with the development of POD, but short-term use as a premedicant is not. However, as this is an observational study, further research is needed to confirm these findings in a controlled setting.

DESIGN: A multicentre nonblinded controlled trial. SETTING: Two university hospitals in Sweden. PATIENTS: Adult patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were enrolled between May 2019 and November 2023. Of 837 patients screened, 112 were randomised, and 110 were included in the analysis: 55 in the intervention and 55 in the control group. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to an opioid-based standard care (control group) or to an opioid-free care pathway (intervention group), including intraoperative OFA and postoperative first-line transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in patient-reported postoperative pain intensity on a numerical rating scale (NRS) from arrival in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) until discharge to the surgical ward. Key secondary outcomes were postoperative pain intensity, in-hospital opioid consumption, and postoperative quality of recovery scale (PQRS) scores. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups regarding the changes in pain intensity from arrival in PACU until discharge to the ward, with mean +\/- SD changes in NRS of 3.20 +\/- 3.01 (intervention) vs. 3.15 +\/- 2.25 (control); mean difference (MD) 0.04 [(95% confidence interval (CI), -1.00 to 1.08); P  = 0.97], and pain intensity at 24 h ( P  = 0.078), 72 h ( P  = 0.060), and 3 months ( P  = 0.30) postoperatively.

The pharmacokinetics of remimazolam have been reported to be similar to those of adult patients after scaling for body size. This article reports on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 yr and a subsequent model-based optimization of the used dosing regimen. METHODS: Thirty-one patients were included in the trial and stratified across four treatment arms: bolus administration, infusion, bolus plus fentanyl, or infusion plus fentanyl. The University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan) Sedation Scale (UMSS) was used to assess the depth of sedation. Blood samples were drawn to measure the concentrations of remimazolam and its metabolite CNS7054. Population pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling was performed in NONMEM (GloboMax LLC, USA). RESULTS: A population pharmacokinetic model was developed for remimazolam and CNS7054. The elimination clearance of remimazolam was 0.70 l . min -1 . 70 kg -1 . A proportional odds model combined with a simplified Minto model described the observed UMSS well. The EC50 of remimazolam for a UMSS score of 3 or greater was 777 ng . ml -1 in the absence of fentanyl, and decreased to 655, 533, and 287 ng\/ml for concomitant fentanyl steady state concentrations of 1, 2, or 4 ng . ml -1 , respectively. Simulations confirmed that the studied dosing regimen resulted in 9.2 to 22.0% of patients not reaching a UMSS score of 3 or greater at the end of the induction. Model-based optimization resulted in higher per-kilogram dosages and the removal of the maximum allowable dose. Simulations indicated that the percentage of patients achieving a UMSS score of 3 or greater can be expected to be high (88 to 97%). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the pharmacokinetics of remimazolam are likely different between children 6 yr or older and adults (after correcting for size). In addition, the exposure-response relationship shows that to effectively use remimazolam for procedural sedation in children 6 yr or older, the dosing regimen should be modified to allow for higher remimazolam exposures.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40355106\/"},{"pmid":40351134,"journal":"Anaesthesia","title":"Impact of tracheal extubation location after surgical procedures on peri-operative times: a prospective dual-centre observational study.","authors":"Godet T; Wajew C; Fabrizi M; Monet C; Pouzeratte Y; Lapeyre M; Adelou S; Pereira B; Garnier M; Chanques G; Jabaudon M; Futier E; Jaber S; De Jong A","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Extubation of the trachea in the operating theatre may increase the time spent there. Conversely, tracheal extubation in the post-anaesthesia care unit may prolong the duration of anaesthesia and increase the incidence of complications. Our primary objective was to quantify the additional occupancy time associated with tracheal extubation in the operating theatre compared with the post-anaesthesia care unit. Secondary objectives were to assess the incidence of complications after tracheal extubation, including the need for ventilatory support. METHODS: This was a prospective dual-centre observational cohort study of patients whose tracheas were intubated for surgery in the operating theatre of two university hospitals. The primary endpoint was operating theatre occupancy time between the end of surgical procedure and discharge from the operating theatre. RESULTS: In total, 756 patients were included, and 494 (65.3%) tracheal extubations occurred in the operating theatre.

A distinct population of gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurons has been recently identified in the central amygdala (CeA) that can be activated by general anesthesia (CeA GA ) and exert antinociceptive functions. In this study, the authors aimed to explore the underlying cellular mechanisms of CeA GA neurons across different phases of nerve injury-induced nociceptive sensitization in mice. METHODS: This study used 107 mice, including 57 males and 50 females. The authors induced c-fos activation in the mice brains using 1.2% isoflurane and validated Fos expression via RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, USA) in situ hybridization. Unlike previous studies using the capturing activated neuronal ensembles method, CeA GA neurons (tdTomato + ) were labeled using the Fos-Targeted Recombination in Active Populations (TRAP2) method. The authors then performed ex vivo electrophysiologic recordings to assess the properties of both Fos-positive\/CeA GA neurons and Fos-negative CeA neurons. Using chemogenetic strategy to selectively activate the CeA GA neurons, the authors investigated pain-like behaviors and associated comorbidities in mice after spared nerve injury (SNI). RESULTS: Isoflurane induced robust Fos expression in CeA gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurons. Electrophysiologic recordings in brain slices revealed that compared to Fos-negative CeA neurons, CeA GA neurons had higher excitability and exhibited distinct patterns of action potentials. Chemogenetic activation of Fos-TRAPed CeA GA neurons increased nociceptive thresholds in naive mice and in mice 2 weeks after SNI, but demonstrated modest antinociception 8 weeks after SNI. Finally, Fos-negative CeA neurons, but not CeA GA neurons, exhibited increased excitability in the chronic phase of SNI, which was correlated with a downregulation of K + -Cl - cotransporter-2 (KCC2) in the CeA (sham vs . SNI 8 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: These results validate the antinociceptive power of CeA GA neurons using a different approach. Additionally, the authors highlight distinct roles of CeA GA neurons in governing physiologic pain, acute pain, and the transition to chronic pain through KCC2 dysregulation.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40333028\/"},{"pmid":40327558,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Sugammadex versus Neostigmine for Reversal of Rocuronium on Gastric Emptying in Adults Undergoing Elective Colorectal Surgery.","authors":"Togioka BM; Rakshe SK; Ye S; Tekkali P; Tsikitis VL; Fang SH; Herzig DO; Lu KC; Aziz MF","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal function is mediated by the cholinergic pathway, which is impacted by neostigmine and glycopyrrolate, but not sugammadex. We hypothesized that sugammadex is associated with earlier gastric emptying in adults undergoing colorectal surgery, compared to neostigmine-glycopyrrolate. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in a pragmatic, single-center, patient and assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. At skin closure, subjects were randomized to sugammadex 2 mg\/kg or neostigmine 0.07 mg\/kg and glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg per 1 mg of neostigmine). The primary end point, gastric emptying, was assessed with the paracetamol absorption test, with greater area under the curve representing faster gastric emptying. Secondary end points included time to first bowel movement, time to achieve adequate reversal (train-of-four ratio >\/=0.9), gastrointestinal complications, hospital length of stay, and postanesthesia care unit recovery time. The analysis was intention-to-treat. RESULTS: All 60 patients randomized to sugammadex received the allocated intervention. Of 60 patients randomized to neostigmine-glycopyrrolate, 56 received neostigmine-glycopyrrolate, 2 received sugammadex, and 2 received both agents. Gastric emptying did not differ significantly between sugammadex (mean [standard deviation SD] area under the curve AUC 1118 [122]) and neostigmine (AUC 1130 [117], P = .58).

METHODS: This was a phase IV, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial of sugammadex in participants aged birth to less than 2 yr (NCT03909165). Part A was open label and included pharmacokinetic assessments to determine whether sugammadex dose adjustment for part B was necessary based on age.

Previous reviews provided low-grade evidence that honey may improve recovery. The BEE PAIN FREE study investigated whether honey alongside multimodal analgesia improved the recovery trajectory in children following tonsillectomy. METHODS: A prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted across three centres in Western Australia. Children undergoing extracapsular tonsillectomy by coblation were allocated randomly to one of four postoperative treatment groups: standard treatment alone; Marri honey (from Western Australia); Manuka honey (from Western Australia); or placebo. The intervention groups took 5 ml of honey or placebo, six times a day, for at least 7 days, in addition to usual discharge analgesia (standard treatment). Data for daily pain scores, Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure scores, medications and unplanned re-presentations were collected. RESULTS: A total of 400 children were recruited; 20% were lost to follow-up or withdrew. The mean number of honey doses taken varied between 2 and 3 doses per day over 7 days. Treatment with honey at this frequency did not impact postoperative pain scores significantly, with all groups showing similar trajectories. These findings did not alter with as-treated analysis or using imputed models for missing data. Most children experienced significant pain until around postoperative day 8. Children allocated to the honey and placebo groups showed some improved oral tolerance around day 6 but had increased vomiting during earlier days. There were no clinically significant differences in medical re-presentations, simple analgesia or oxycodone usage between groups. DISCUSSION: Two to three doses daily of oral honey\/placebo in children post-extracapsular tonsillectomy for 7 days, in addition to regular paracetamol, ibuprofen and as required oxycodone did not result in a clinical improvement in pain or recovery over a 14-day follow-up period.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40321015\/"},{"pmid":40260456,"journal":"European journal of anaesthesiology","title":"Context-specific clinical applicability of the end-expiratory occlusion test to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","authors":"Mulder MP; Potters JW; van Loon LM; Rumindo K; Hallback M; Maksuti E; Donker DW; Diez C","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The emergence of context-specific clinical evidence from the end-expiratory occlusion test (EEOT) may change the perception of its operative performance to predict fluid responsiveness. OBJECTIVES: Assessment of predictive performance of the EEOT in the intensive care unit (ICU) and operating room. DESIGN: Systematic review of observational diagnostic test accuracy studies with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus were used as data sources for relevant publications until February 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Prospective clinical studies in which the EEOT was used to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated adults, regardless of the clinical care context. The operative performance characteristics must also have been reported. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies involving 1073 adult patients (588 receiving intensive care and 485 in the operating room) were systematically reviewed, and 22 studies comprising 1049 volume expansions were meta-analysed. The pooled sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI)] of the EEOT was 0.87 (0.81 to 0.92), and the pooled specificity was 0.90 (0.85 to 0.94); the median [interquartile range] cardiac index ( CI ) threshold for a positive test was a 5.0 [3.3 to 5.3] increase. The clinical context, the method used for haemodynamic monitoring, the ratio of the averaging time of the monitoring method to the occlusion time, the levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and the choice of cardiac output marker were identified as significant sources of heterogeneity. However, the occlusion duration and tidal volume did not significantly affect its performance. A novel insight is that performance was notably lower in the operating room setting. The likelihood ratios were 14 (positive) and 0.12 (negative) for the ICU, both better than 3.1 and 0.21 for the operating room. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed to be very low, mainly due to high heterogeneity and risk of bias; however, no publication bias was detected. CONCLUSION: The EEOT for predicting fluid responsiveness in critical care performs acceptably well overall and is a confirmative test. In the operating room and\/or with specific technical settings, its performance and clinical utility are reduced, driving the need for more context-specific and patient-specific fluid responsiveness assessments.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40260456\/"},{"pmid":40258137,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"Breath Analysis of Propofol and Associated Metabolic Signatures: A Pilot Study Using Secondary Electrospray Ionization-High-resolution Mass Spectrometry.","authors":"Zeng J; Stankovic N; Singh KD; Steiner R; Frey U; Erb T; Sinues P","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Propofol is a widely used anesthetic for total IV anesthesia. Although it is generally safe, rare but serious complications can occur in vulnerable groups, such as critically ill patients and children. Clinicians often rely on surrogate measures ( e.g. , predicted effect-site concentrations or Bispectral Index), yet more direct indicators of anesthetic exposure and metabolic stress would be valuable. The authors hypothesized that pharmacometabolomics via breath analysis could yield real-time insights into propofol concentrations as well as accompanying metabolic responses to surgery. METHODS: In this pilot study, 10 pediatric patients (median age, 5.9 yr; interquartile range, 4.3 to 6.6) undergoing propofol anesthesia contributed 47 breath samples (10 preinduction, 37 postinduction) and 37 blood samples. All samples were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Linear mixed-effects models examined associations between exhaled compounds and serum propofol concentrations while accounting for repeated measures in individual patients. Volcano plots were used to identify differential changes in metabolites after propofol induction. RESULTS: Propofol, its metabolites, and endogenous metabolites were readily detected in exhaled breath, demonstrating strong correlations with serum propofol concentrations (partial R (2) >\/= 0.65; adjusted P < 0.001). Differential analysis showed significant upregulation of endogenous fatty aldehydes (log 2 [postinduction\/preinduction] >\/= 1; adjusted P <\/= 0.05), suggestive of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. Exogenous compounds, including benzene and phenols, were also observed, reflecting propofol metabolism in vivo . CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study highlights a robust breath-serum relationship for propofol and reveals surgery-associated shifts in metabolic pathways, including evidence of oxidative stress. These findings underscore the feasibility of exhaled-breath pharmacometabolomics for individualized anesthetic care. Further validation in larger cohorts is warranted to confirm clinical utility and to determine whether real-time breath analysis could ultimately serve as a useful adjunct for guiding anesthetic management and monitoring perioperative metabolic responses.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40258137\/"},{"pmid":40251137,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"Association Between Neuromuscular Blockade and Its Reversal With Postoperative Delirium in Older Patients: A Hospital Registry Study.","authors":"Ahrens E; Wachtendorf LJ; Shay D; Tenge T; Paschold BS; Rudolph MI; Redaelli S; Kaiser L; Suleiman A; Ma H; Fassbender PJ; Schaefer MS","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (ND-NMBAs) are dose-dependently associated with residual paralysis, delayed recovery, and prolonged hospitalization, factors that can predispose patients to postoperative delirium. We hypothesized that neuromuscular blockade is associated with a higher risk of delirium after surgery, and that this can be mitigated by administration of reversal agents. METHODS: In total, 53,772 adult hospitalized patients aged >\/=60 years who underwent general anesthesia for noncardiac, nonneurosurgical, nontransplant procedures between 2008 and 2024 at a tertiary health care network in Massachusetts, were included. The exposure was the intraoperative administration of ND-NMBAs. The primary outcome was 7-day delirium, identified from nursing and physician charts using a keyword-based search strategy paired with manual chart review, Confusion Assessment Method assessments, and International Classification of Diseases (9th\/10th Revision, Clinical Modification) diagnostic codes. RESULTS: In total, 43,723 (81.3%) patients received neuromuscular blockade. Approximately 2259 (4.2%) patients developed delirium, 1884 (4.3%) with, and 375 (3.7%) without ND-NMBA administration. In adjusted analyses, administration of ND-NMBAs was dose-dependently associated with a higher risk of postoperative delirium (adjusted odds ratio [OR adj ] 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.31; P = .038 and 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.12; P < .001 per each unit increase in the effective dose required to achieve a 95% twitch reduction). 38,143 (87.2%) patients who received ND-NMBAs also received a reversal agent, which was associated with a lower risk of impaired neuromuscular recovery (preextubation train-of-four ratio <95; OR adj 0.60; 95% CI, 0.49-0.74; P < .001) and delirium (OR adj 0.73; 95% CI, 0.64-0.83; P < .001), compared to no reversal. The adverse effect of ND-NMBAs on delirium risk was eliminated by reversal agent administration (OR adj 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94-1.23; P = .30 with and OR adj 1.52; 95% CI, 1.28-1.79; P < .001 without reversal agent administration).

Anesthesia providers from U.S. hospitals were surveyed in 2022 to 2023 to provide data for their hospitals from 2021. The primary hypothesis was that obstetric anesthesia services have changed in the last decade. METHODS: Previous workforce surveys were used to develop the 32-question survey about contemporary obstetric anesthesia practice. A hospital sample (n = 1,180) was generated based on number of births per year and U.S. census region. Using web-push survey methodology, a QR code was assigned to the \"Chief of Anesthesiology\" at each hospital. A link to an online Research Electron Data Capture survey was emailed to individuals along with reminder communications. Nonresponding hospitals received paper surveys and self-addressed stamped envelopes for survey return. The results were analyzed using R statistical package at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: There were 284 (24%) responses to the survey. Hospitals providing obstetric care have decreased 50% over four decades. Of all the respondents, 77% work in nonacademic hospitals without residency programs. Comparing academic to nonacademic hospitals, academic providers are less likely to have other clinical responsibilities: 35% versus 62%, respectively. The weighted overall rate of neuraxial labor analgesia is 84%. Elective cesarean deliveries are usually performed with spinal anesthesia (85%). Neuraxial anesthesia is used in 86% of urgent cesareans, while 14% use general anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite stable annual birth rates in the United States, the number of hospitals providing obstetric care decreased by 50% over the last 40 yr. This study describes nonacademic practice and not just academic teaching hospitals. Increased access to neuraxial labor analgesia is a dramatic step toward reducing in-hospital maternal mortality and improving healthcare disparities.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40237779\/"},{"pmid":40237771,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"Development and External Validation of a Novel In-hospital Mortality Model after Pediatric Congenital Heart Surgery: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study.","authors":"Tong C; Li Q; Du X; Shan M; Zhang Y; Wu H; Shen Z; Xu Z; Ge X; Cai S; Fu X; Zhang K; Zhang H; Li S; Miao C; Zheng J","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The applicability of four major traditional in-hospital mortality models in the Chinese setting is unclear due to disease spectrum and population heterogeneity. This study aimed to test the performance of these models in the Chinese setting and to construct and externally validate a novel model. METHODS: A total of 21,855 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent congenital heart surgery from January 2015 to December 2021 in Shanghai Children's Medical Center were enrolled. For external validation, the study additionally pooled 5,221 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent this surgical treatment from January 2020 to December 2021 in Beijing Fuwai Hospital. The performance of the Aristotle Basis Complexity (ABC) score, Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS)-1 categories, Society of Thoracic Surgeons-European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (STAT) score, and STAT categories was tested. Independent predictors were used to develop a model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) and Brier score were used to examine the model performance. RESULTS: The AUROCs were 0.778 for ABC score, 0.685 for RACHS-1 categories, 0.808 for STAT score, and 0.784 for STAT categories. When preoperative covariates were added to the four models, the AUROCs improved: ABC score (AUROC = 0.860), RACHS-1 categories (AUROC = 0.844), STAT score (AUROC = 0.856), and STAT categories (AUROC = 0.864). The best-performing model incorporated six variables, including age, height, oxygen support, previous cardiac operation, emergency surgery, and STAT categories. The AUROCs and Brier score were 0.864 and 0.00977 in the development cohort and 0.860 and 0.00654 in the external validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The four major traditional models were only moderately effective in predicting in-hospital mortality after congenital heart surgery in the Chinese setting. The novel model founded on the STAT categories in combination with preoperative covariates can serve as a useful and effective tool for predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality after congenital heart surgery in the Chinese setting.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40237771\/"},{"pmid":40235368,"journal":"Anaesthesia","title":"Pulmonary complications after intrathecal morphine administration: a systematic review and meta-analysis with meta-regression and trial sequential analysis.","authors":"El-Boghdadly K; Renard Y; Rossel JB; Moka E; Volk T; Rawal N; Jaques C; Szyszko M; Albrecht E","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Intrathecal morphine provides effective postoperative analgesia, but there are concerns about potential pulmonary complications influencing peri-operative management. We aimed to determine whether there is an association between intrathecal morphine administration and pulmonary complications after non-obstetric surgery. We also aimed to determine whether there was a dose-dependent effect on pulmonary complications. METHODS: We searched the literature systematically for randomised controlled trials comparing intrathecal morphine vs. control in patients undergoing any type of non-obstetric surgery under general or spinal anaesthesia. Primary outcomes were rates of postoperative sedation, respiratory depression and hypoxaemia. We performed a meta-analysis and meta-regression for each of our outcomes of interest and conducted trial sequential analysis to assess whether the required information size was achieved. RESULTS: We included 127 trials (7388 patients). Rates of sedation and hypoxaemia were not increased significantly in patients receiving intrathecal morphine (odds ratio 1.00, 95%CI 0.78-1.28, p = 0.98, moderate quality evidence; and 1.22, 95%CI 0.84-1.79, p = 0.30, moderate quality evidence, respectively). There were more episodes of respiratory depression in patients receiving intrathecal morphine than control (odds ratio 1.78, 95%CI 1.19-2.67, p = 0.005, very low-quality evidence), which was no longer significant when morphine doses > 500 mug were not included (odds ratio1.49, 95%CI 0.99-2.23, p = 0.06). Meta-regression revealed associations between dose and rate of sedation, respiratory depression and hypoxaemia, but when doses of > 500 mug were not included, these associations did not persist. Trial sequential analyses suggest that further data may still be required for all outcomes, but statistical significance was reached for respiratory depression. DISCUSSION: There is moderate evidence that intrathecal morphine does not increase rates of sedation or hypoxaemia after non-obstetric surgery. There is very low-quality evidence that intrathecal morphine might increase the rate of respiratory depression.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40235368\/"},{"pmid":40230320,"journal":"Anaesthesia","title":"Outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure undergoing non-cardiac surgery: a secondary analysis of the METREPAIR international cohort study.","authors":"Kirkopoulos A; M'Pembele R; Roth S; Stroda A; Larmann J; Gillmann HJ; Kotfis K; Ganter MT; Bolliger D; Filipovic M; Guzzetti L; Mauermann E; Ionescu D; Spadaro S; Szczeklik W; De Hert S; Beck-Schimmer B; Howell SJ; Lurati Buse GA","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Heart failure is a frequent comorbidity in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and an acknowledged risk factor for postoperative mortality.

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of MET-REPAIR, an international prospective cohort study including patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery aged >\/= 45 y with increased cardiovascular risk. Main exposures were stable chronic heart failure and availability of a pre-operative transthoracic echocardiogram. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative major adverse cardiovascular events at 30 days. Secondary endpoints included 30-day mortality and severe in-hospital complications. Multivariable logistic regression models were calculated. RESULTS: Of 15,158 included patients, 3880 (25.6%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for stable chronic heart failure, of whom 1397 (36%) were female. Chronic heart failure was associated with increased risk of postoperative 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 2.04, 95%CI 1.59-2.60), 30-day mortality (OR 1.50, 95%CI 1.17-1.92) and in-hospital complications (OR 1.47, 95%CI 1.30-1.66).

Reference ranges are derived from healthy volunteers but may not be interchangeable with those from patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Furthermore, sex and age seem to influence rotational thromboelastometry profiles. We performed a secondary analysis of two prospective observational study cohorts from a single centre in the Netherlands, which establishes pre-operative ROTEM((R)) sigma reference ranges for adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery and examines sex- and age-specific variations. METHODS: Reference ranges (2.5-97.5th percentiles) were compared with those reported by the manufacturer by calculating 95%CIs around the percentiles. Sex- and age-specific variations were evaluated similarly by creating subgroups (comparing males with females and different age groups) and calculating the 95%CIs for the ranges in each subgroup. Non-overlapping CIs indicated statistically significant different ranges. RESULTS: We included 381 patients in the analysis. Differences were found in ROTEM sigma reference ranges compared with those stated by the manufacturer: EXTEM and FIBTEM clot firmness upper limits were higher, and clotting time ranges in EXTEM and INTEM were wider. The lower limit of LI60 EXTEM was lower. When comparing males (n = 260) and females (n = 121), female patients had shorter CT EXTEM and higher A5, A10 and MCF in EXTEM and FIBTEM, but the reference ranges were not significantly different. No differences in medians or reference bounds were found across four age categories, divided by quartiles. DISCUSSION: Reference ranges for patients undergoing cardiac surgery differed from the manufacturer reference ranges. Pre-operatively, female patients exhibited a slightly more hypercoagulable ROTEM profile than males when comparing medians, though the reference ranges were similar. No differences were found across age categories. Cardiovascular-specific, but not sex- or age-specific ROTEM sigma reference ranges might be needed.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40230308\/"},{"pmid":40227959,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"Development of the Pediatric Scale for Quality of Recovery (PedSQoR).","authors":"Graydon C; Stricker PA; Kelleher S; Cravero J; Karim N; Muhly WT; Lee-Archer P","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Measuring the quality of a patient's recovery is vital, and reliable patient-centered outcome metrics are needed for clinical investigations and quality improvement. Currently, assessment tools to measure quality of recovery in pediatric patients are lacking. This study aimed to develop a scale to assess the quality of recovery construct in pediatric patients. METHODS: Using a mixed-methods investigative model, item generation was achieved using two complementary approaches. First, a comprehensive review of the literature identified tools and questions that assessed the endpoints relevant to recovery in children. Questions were categorized and then assessed by an expert Delphi panel who determined the most significant domains and items to be included. Concurrently, semistructured interviews were conducted with patients and their families to identify themes related to recovery that were important to patients and families. The resulting pilot questionnaire was administered to patients and their families presenting for elective surgery in the United States and Australia. RESULTS: The literature search identified 41 instruments, comprising 216 questions relevant to recovery. After the initial Delphi round, the item list was reduced to 91 questions, and then to 50 questions after the second round. The themes identified in the semistructured interviews aligned with domains considered important by a panel of experts. A 50-item questionnaire was administered to 1,162 children at multiple timepoints after surgery. Item reduction and factor analysis resulted in the 20-item Pediatric Scale for Quality of Recovery that assesses the domains relevant to physical and psychologic recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The Pediatric Scale for Quality of Recovery scale is a 20-item questionnaire designed to provide a holistic representation of a child's physical, emotional, and psychologic recovery after surgery and anesthesia. It was developed and validated with consumer involvement and a strong patient-centered focus. Once further validation has been established, it is expected to become a standardized endpoint in pediatric perioperative trials and quality improvement projects.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40227959\/"},{"pmid":40223488,"journal":"European journal of anaesthesiology","title":"Remimazolam for successful sedation in children with left-to-right shunt congenital heart disease: An up-and-down sequential allocation trial.","authors":"Jin M; Lin H; Qiu L; Xu H; Zhang H; Hou S","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The findings of this study offer insights into the utilisation of remimazolam for sedation in paediatric patients with left-to-right shunt congenital heart disease (CHD).

METHODS: This was a single-blind, 1:1:1, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of 92 healthy volunteers ages 18 to 40 yr. Effect-site concentrations were targeted for propofol (1.0 mcg\/ml), dexmedetomidine (0.15 ng\/ml), or fentanyl (0.9 ng\/ml). Participants listened to a series of 80 words creating a mental picture. Thirty were accompanied by a 2-s painful shock. Blood oxygen-weighted images were obtained at 7 T using a custom head coil. The primary outcome was next-day memory performance, measured by d', a normalized measure of correct identifications versus false positives. Mixed models were fit to test outcome differences between drug groups. Only statistically significant ( P < 0.05) changes are reported, after adjustment for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Recollection, reported as mean d' (95% CI), was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.34) under no drug.

Propofol decreased memory-encoding activation of the hippocampus and amygdala. Propofol reduced pain-related activation in the insula, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and amygdala. Dexmedetomidine showed decreased memory-related activation in the hippocampus but did not change pain ratings or show activation differences in pain-processing areas.

Both fluids and vasopressors increase blood pressure (BP) by inducing different physiological response. We devised a protocol which relies on dynamic arterial elastance (Ea dyn ) to guide BP optimisation during major abdominal surgery, and tested its effectiveness on tissue perfusion. OBJECTIVE: To explore if an Ea dyn -based optimisation protocol could affect lactate levels, fluid administration, and postoperative clinical complications. DESIGN: Randomised open-label clinical trial. SETTING: High-volume tertiary care centre for pancreatic surgery. PATIENTS: From 58 patients scheduled for cephalic duodenopancreatectomy 46 were eligible for the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the lactate value one hour after extubation. Secondary endpoints were fluid balance, intra-operative hypotension and postoperative complications. In the control group, hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg) was treated based on stroke volume variation (SVV) while in the experimental group the treatment was based on assessment of dynamic arterial elastance (Ea dyn group). Patient demographic and pre-operative laboratory data were recorded. All haemodynamic data, including oxygen delivery and consumption, were recorded at four time points: after intubation (T0), after fascia opening (T1), after fascia closing (T2) and one hour after extubation (T3). RESULTS: The patients were 70 [63 to 76] years and 15 (33%) were ASA 3. Lactate levels at T3 were similar between the control and Ea dyn groups. Oxygen consumption was higher in the Ea dyn group at T3, and lactate had a significant percentage decrease from T2 to T3: median [IQR], -24.5 [-30 to -14] vs. 0 [-24 to 7.6]%, P  = 0.004). Those in Ea dyn group received more vasopressors and had a lower fluid balance at T3: 2700 [2100 to 3800] vs. 2200 [1060 to 3000] ml, P  = 0.020). There were no significant differences either in postoperative complications or hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: A protocol including Ea dyn to treat hypotension did not reduce lactate after major abdominal surgery, but it was associated with a significant reduction in fluid balance and increase in oxygen consumption.

Our aim was to report the prevalence of, and outcomes from, alcohol-related liver disease after admission to ICUs in Scotland. METHODS: We performed a secondary data analysis using linked Scottish national databases of all adult general ICUs in Scotland. We compared emergency non-surgical patients admitted to ICU with and without alcohol-related liver disease. The primary outcome was ICU mortality, and secondary outcomes were ICU admission rate ratio; 60-day mortality; 2-year mortality; duration of ICU and hospital stay; and need for hospital readmission. RESULTS: Of the 49,420\/103,103 (47.9%) patients admitted to ICU with emergency non-surgical diagnoses between 2010 and 2018, we identified 2629\/49,420 (5.3%) patients with alcohol-related liver disease. Patients with alcohol-related liver disease were more likely to receive three-organ support (14.0% vs. 10.0%, p < 0.001). Mortality in the ICU was higher in patients with alcohol-related liver disease (964\/2629 (36.7%) vs. 10,517\/46,791 (22.5%), respectively; aOR 2.03 (95%CI 1.85-2.24)). Patients with alcohol-related liver disease who specifically presented to ICU with a gastrointestinal bleed had a lower ICU mortality (95\/487 (19.5%)). Sixty-day mortality of patients with alcohol-related liver disease increased with higher levels of organ support (186\/516 (36.0%) mortality with zero organs supported vs. 162\/196 (82.7%) mortality with three organs supported). DISCUSSION: Early mortality was high in patients with alcohol-related liver disease who were admitted to ICU, especially if multi-organ support was required. However, nearly one-fifth of patients on multi-organ support survived to hospital discharge. Early mortality for patients with alcohol-related liver disease admitted with a gastrointestinal bleed was considerably lower and should be taken into consideration when considering management in ICU. In discussion with the patient and hepatologists, a trial of organ support with continuous re-evaluation may be appropriate.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40070011\/"},{"pmid":40052487,"journal":"European journal of anaesthesiology","title":"Peri-operative dexmedetomidine and emergence agitation in adults undergoing nasal surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","authors":"Wegner GRM; Wegner BFM; Silva LS; Arias JA","abstract":"BACKGROUND: There is a high risk of emergence agitation associated with nasal surgery.

Peri-operative immune dysregulation is likely induced by surgical damage and anaesthetics, but remains far from comprehensively characterised. To address this, the effects of individual drugs on immune function must be explored.

OBJECTIVE: Investigate the potential immunomodulatory effect of sugammadex. DESIGN: An in-vitro experiment, randomised controlled pilot study and retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve healthy donors, 20 adults undergoing total hip arthroplasty and 1000 major abdominal surgery patients. INTERVENTION: In vitro: isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to sugammadex and rocuronium before stimulation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS).Pilot study: patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under single shot spinal anaesthesia randomised to sugammadex (8 mg kg -1 ) or placebo at the end of surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: In vitro: TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6 production capacity.Pilot study: Ex-vivo cytokine production capacity after whole blood stimulation with LPS.Retrospective cohort: sugammadex as a predictor of postoperative infectious complications. RESULTS: In vitro : rocuronium suppressed TNF and IL-1beta production capacity. Higher doses of sugammadex (100 and 1000 mug ml -1 ; 100 mug ml -1 corresponds to plasma concentration reached upon 8 mg kg -1 sugammadex) restored suppression of TNF and IL-1beta.Pilot study: no differences in ex-vivo cytokine production capacity between the sugammadex and placebo group at the end of surgery or on postoperative day 1.Retrospective cohort study : no association between sugammadex and postoperative infectious complications (OR = 1.000, 95% CI 0.998 to 1.002).

Gut microbiota produces various metabolites and influences the brain function and development of the host. This relationship is referred to as the gut-brain axis. Gut microbiota may influence developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity caused by sevoflurane exposure. This study investigated the effect of changes in the composition of gut microbiota after fecal microbiota transplantation on spatial learning disability caused by developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity in neonatal rats. METHODS: Neonatal rats were allocated into the Control (n = 10) and Sevo (n = 10) groups in Experiment 1 and the Sevo (n = 20) and Sevo+FMT (n = 20) groups in Experiment 2, according to the randomly allocated mothers' group. The rats in Sevo and Sevo+FMT groups were exposed to 2.1% sevoflurane for 2 hours on postnatal days 7 to 13. Neonatal rats in the Sevo+FMT group received fecal microbiota transplantation immediately after sevoflurane exposure on postnatal days 7 to 13. The samples for fecal microbiota transplantation were obtained from nonanesthetized healthy adult rats. Behavioral tests, including Open field, Y-maze, Morris water maze, and reversal Morris water maze tests, were performed to evaluate spatial learning ability on postnatal days 26 to 39. RESULTS: Experiment 1 revealed that sevoflurane exposure significantly altered the gut microbiota composition. The relative abundance of Roseburia (effect value: 1.01) and Bacteroides genus (effect value: 1.03) increased significantly after sevoflurane exposure, whereas that of Lactobacillus (effect value: -1.20) decreased significantly. Experiment 2 revealed that fecal microbiota transplantation improved latency to target (mean +\/- SEM; Sevo group: 9.7 +\/- 8.2 seconds vs, Sevo+FMT group: 2.7 +\/- 2.4 seconds, d =1.16, 95% confidence interval: -12.7 to -1.3 seconds, P = .019) and target zone crossing times (Sevo group: 2.4 +\/- 1.6 vs, Sevo+FMT group: 5.4 +\/- 1.4, d =1.99, 95% confidence interval: 2.0-5.0, P < .001) in the reversal Morris water maze test. Microbiota analysis revealed that the alpha-diversity of gut microbiota increased after fecal microbiota transplantation. Similarly, the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum (effect value: 1.44), Ruminococcus genus (effect value: 1.69), and butyrate-producing bacteria increased after fecal microbiota transplantation. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation increased the fecal concentration of butyrate and induced histone acetylation and the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus, thereby suppressing neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The alternation of gut microbiota after fecal microbiota transplantation influenced spatial learning ability in neonatal rats with developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity. Modulation of the gut microbiota may be an effective prophylaxis for developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity in children.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/39899452\/"},{"pmid":39773745,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"Pharmacokinetics of Methadone in Adult Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery With Cardiopulmonary Bypass.","authors":"Salas WE; Cortinez LI; Lopez RA; Rolle A; Elgueta F; Godoy CO; Giordano A; Contreras V; Anderson BJ","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induces profound physiological changes that may alter the pharmacokinetics of methadone.

Arterial blood samples (n = 10) were taken, before, during, and after CPB. Pharmacokinetic analysis was undertaken using nonlinear mixed effects models. RESULTS: All patients completed the study. The median [interquartile range] methadone concentrations decreased from 34.8 [23.9-48.2] ng\/mL (10 minutes before CPB) to 18.2 [9.9-26] ng\/mL after 60 minutes of CPB ( P < .001). A 3-compartment model adequately described the observed changes in methadone concentrations. The influence of CPB on methadone pharmacokinetics was best described by hemodilution in a fixed volume of 1.5 L (CPB circuit volume) and by sequestration from the CPB components (CL SEQ = 93.4 L\/h, 95%CI 59-124, P < .01). The observed effect of CPB in methadone pharmacokinetics can be compensated by giving a supplementary bolus dose of 0.05 mg\/kg at the end of CPB.

Comorbid conditions are likely important predictors of CV risk in pregnant people. Currently, there is no way to predict which people with HDP are at risk of acute CV complications. We developed and validated a predictive model for all CV events and for heart failure, renal failure, and cerebrovascular events specifically after HDP. METHODS: Models were created using the Premier Healthcare Database. The inclusion criteria for the model dataset were delivery with an HDP with discharge from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2020. Machine learning methods were used to derive predictive models of CV events occurring during delivery hospitalization (Index Model) or during readmission (Readmission Model) using a training set (60%) to estimate model parameters, a validation set (20%) to tune model hyperparameters and select a final model, and a test set (20%) to evaluate final model performance. RESULTS: The total model cohort consisted of 553,658 deliveries with an HDP. A CV event occurred in 6501 (1.2%) of the delivery hospitalizations. Multilabel neural networks were selected for the Index Model and Readmission Model due to favorable performance compared to alternatives. This approach is designed for prediction of multiple events that share risk factors and may cooccur. The Index Model predicted all CV events with area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) 0.878 and average precision (AP) 0.239 (cerebrovascular events: AUROC 0.941, heart failure: AUROC 0.898, and renal failure: AUROC 0.885). With a positivity threshold set to achieve >\/=90% sensitivity, model specificity was 65.0%, 83.5%, 68.6%, and 65.6% for predicting all CV events, cerebrovascular events, heart failure, and renal failure, respectively. CV events within 1 year of delivery occurred in 3018 (0.6%) individuals. The Readmission Model predicted all CV events with AUROC 0.717 and AP 0.022 (renal failure: AUROC 0.748, heart failure: AUROC 0.734, and cerebrovascular events AUROC 0.698). Feature importance analysis indicated that the presence of chronic renal disease, cardiac disease, pulmonary hypertension, and preeclampsia with severe features had the greatest effect on the prediction of CV events.

We hypothesized that muscle-related parameters are associated with the occurrence of postoperative complications. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective observational study. Adult patients who underwent colorectal tumor resection surgery under general anesthesia between 2018.09.01 and 2021.09.01 were enrolled. The last abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan images obtained within 3 months before surgery were used to calculate the L3 SMI and HUAC.

Propofol is nonselective for gamma amino butyric acid type A receptor subtypes (GABA A R) as it enhances all 3 GABA A R subtypes (slow, fast, and tonic). Our newly developed anesthetic class selectively targets GABA A R-slow synapses to depress brain responsiveness. We hypothesized that a selective GABA A R-slow agonist, KSEB 01-S2, would produce a different EEG signature compared to the broad-spectrum GABA A R agonist (propofol), and tested this using rat EEG recordings. METHODS: Male rats were studied after Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) approval from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense and the University of Michigan. Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane (3%-5% induction, 1%-3% maintenance) with oxygen at 0.5 to 1.0 L\/min. Stainless steel screws were placed in the skull and used to record subcranial cortical EEG signals. After recovery, either propofol or KSEB 01-S2 was administered and effects on EEG signals were analyzed. RESULTS: As previously reported, propofol produced increased power in delta frequencies (0.1-4 Hz) compared to predrug recordings and produced a decrease in EEG power >30 Hz but no significant changes were seen within +\/-20 seconds of losing the righting reflex. By contrast, KSEB 01-S2 produced a significant increase in theta frequency percent power (median 14.7%, 16.2\/13.8, 75\/25 confidence interval; to 34.7%, 35\/31.8; P < .015) and a significant decrease in low gamma frequency percent power (16.9%, 18.6\/15.8; to 5.45%, 5.5\/5.39; P < .015) for all rats at +\/- 20 seconds of loss of consciousness (LOC). Both anesthetics produced a flattening of chaotic attractor plots from nonlinear dynamic analyses, like that produced by volatile and dissociative anesthetics at LOC. CONCLUSIONS: KSEB 01-S2 produced a markedly different EEG pattern, with a selective increase observed in the theta frequency range. KSEB 01-S2 also differs markedly in its activity at the GABA A R-slow receptor subtype, suggesting a possible mechanistic link between receptor subtype specificity and EEG frequency band signatures. Increased theta together with depressed gamma frequencies is interesting because GABA A R slow synapses have previously been suggested to underlie theta frequency oscillations, while fast synapses control gamma activity. These reciprocal effects support a previous model for theta and nested gamma oscillations based on inhibitory connections between GABA A R fast and slow interneurons. Although each anesthetic produced a unique EEG response, propofol and KSEB 01-S2 both increased slow wave activity and flattened chaotic attractor plots at the point of LOC.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/39466672\/"},{"pmid":39453983,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"Xenon and Argon as Neuroprotective Treatments for Perinatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury: A Preclinical Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","authors":"Barros M; Liang M; Iannucci N; Dickinson R","abstract":"Xenon and argon are currently being evaluated as potential neuroprotective treatments for acquired brain injuries.

Digital pharmacovigilance strategies that use noninvasive sensors to identify physiologic adaptations to opioid use represent a novel strategy to facilitate safer opioid prescribing. This study aims to identify wearable sensor-derived features associated with opioid dependence by comparing opioid-naive individuals to chronic opioid users with acute pain and developing a machine-learning model to distinguish between the 2 groups. METHODS: Using a longitudinal observational study design, continuous physiologic data were collected on participants with acute pain receiving opioid analgesia. Monitoring continued throughout hospitalization and for up to 7 days posthospital discharge. Opioid administration data were obtained from electronic health record (EHR) and participant self-report. Participants were classified as belonging to 1 of 3 categories based on opioid use history: naive, occasional, or chronic use. Thirty features were derived from sensor data, and an additional 9 features were derived from participant demographic and treatment characteristics. Physiologic feature behavior immediately postopioid use was compared among naive and chronic participants, and subsequently features were used to generate machine learning models which were validated using cross-validation and holdout data. RESULTS: Forty-one participants with a combined total of 169 opioid administrations were ultimately included in the final analysis. Four interpretable decision tree-based machine learning models with 14 sensor-based and 5 clinical features were developed to predict class membership on the level of a given observation (dose) and on the participant level. Ranges for model metrics on the participant level were as follows: accuracy 70% to 90%, sensitivity 67% to 100%, and specificity 67% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable sensor-derived digital biomarkers can be used to predict opioid use status (naive versus chronic) and the differentiating features may be detecting opioid dependence. Future work should be aimed at further delineating the phenomenon identified in these models (including opioid dependence and\/or withdrawal) and at identifying transition states where an individual changes from 1 profile to another with repetitive opioid exposure.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/39413034\/"},{"pmid":39259695,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"Intrathecal Drug Delivery System in Prepontine Cistern for Patients with Intractable Craniofacial Cancer Pain: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.","authors":"Long D; Li X; Zhang Y; Luo J; Liu B; Hong B; Yang F; Zou C; Ge F; Zhang A; Zhou H; Xiao Y; Wang Y","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with craniofacial cancer frequently suffer from severe pain.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with primary or metastatic craniofacial cancer pain who received the catheter placement of an intrathecal morphine pump into the prepontine cistern in eleven medical centers from September 2019 to December 2023. Friedman test and pairwise signed-rank test were used to evaluate the difference in numeric rating scale (NRS) scores, the number of breakthrough pain episodes, dose of intrathecal morphine, and dose of systemic morphine equivalents (oral, patch, intravenous) from preoperative period to postoperative days 1, 7, and 30. P values were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni test. RESULTS: The study included 33 patients. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of NRS scores at days 1, 7, and 30 postimplant were 2.0 (1.0-3.5), 2.0 (1.0-2.0), and 1.0 (1.0-2.0), respectively, which was significantly lower than that before surgery (median, 8.0; IQR, 7.0-10.0; all P < .001). Compared to baseline number\/d of breakthrough pain episodes (median, 6.0; IQR, 4.5-10.0), there was a progressive decrease in the number\/d of breakthrough pain episodes at day 1, day 7, and day 30 postimplant, and the median (IQR) were 1.0 (0.0-3.0), 2.0 (0.0-3.0), and 0.0 (0.0-1.2), respectively (all P < .001). Approximately 78.8% and 96.7% of patients reported pain relief >50% at days 1 and 30 postimplant, respectively. Compared with that at day 1 postimplant, the proportion of patients with a pain relief rate >75% at day 30 postimplant also increased with continued intrathecal treatment. Compared to the dose of baseline systemic morphine equivalents (median, 228 mg.d -1 ; IQR, 120-408 mg.d -1 ), the dose of systemic morphine equivalents reduced significantly from 0(0-120) mg.d -1 at day 1 postimplant ( P = .001), to 0 (0-0) mg.d -1 at days 7 and 30 postimplant (both P < .001). Few patients reported perioperative adverse events, including nausea, constipation, hypotension, urinary retention, dry mouth, headache, and sedation. No severe adverse events occurred.

This procedure could be considered in patients with severe refractory craniofacial cancer pain.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/39259695\/"},{"pmid":39207913,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"Ketamine Analgo-sedation for Mechanically Ventilated Critically Ill Adults: A Rapid Practice Guideline from the Saudi Critical Care Society and the Scandinavian Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine.","authors":"Amer M; Hylander Moller M; Alshahrani M; Shehabi Y; Arabi YM; Alshamsi F; Ingi Sigurethsson M; Rehn M; Chew MS; Kalliomaki ML; Lewis K; Al-Suwaidan FA; Al-Dorzi HM; Al-Fares A; Alsadoon N; Bell CM; Groth CM; Parke R; Mehta S; Wischmeyer PE; Al-Omari A; Olkkola KT; Alhazzani W","abstract":"BACKGROUND: This Rapid Practice Guideline (RPG) aimed to provide evidence‑based recommendations for ketamine analgo-sedation (monotherapy and adjunct) versus non-ketamine sedatives or usual care in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients on invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) and to identify knowledge gaps for future research. METHODS: The RPG panel comprised 23 multinational multidisciplinary panelists, including a patient representative. An up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis constituted the evidence base. The Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, and the evidence-to-decision framework were used to assess the certainty of evidence and to move from evidence to decision\/recommendation. The panel provided input on the balance of the desirable and undesirable effects, certainty of evidence, patients' values and preferences, costs, resources, equity, feasibility, acceptability, and research priorities. RESULTS: Data from 17 randomized clinical trials (n=898) and 9 observational studies (n=1934) were included. There was considerable uncertainty about the desirable and undesirable effects of ketamine monotherapy for analgo-sedation. The evidence was very low certainty and downgraded for risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency. Uncertainty or variability in values and preferences were identified. Costs, resources, equity, and acceptability were considered varied. Adjunctive ketamine therapy had no effect on mortality (within 28 days) (relative risk [RR] 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.27; low certainty), and may slightly reduce iMV duration (days) (mean difference [MD] -0.05 days; 95% CI -0.07 to -0.03; low certainty), and uncertain effect on the cumulative dose of opioids (mcg\/kg\/h morphine equivalent) (MD -11.6; 95% CI -20.4 to -2.7; very low certainty). Uncertain desirable effects (cumulative dose of sedatives and vasopressors) and undesirable effects (adverse event rate, delirium, arrhythmia, hepatotoxicity, hypersalivation, use of physical restraints) were also identified. A possibility of important uncertainty or variability in patient-important outcomes led to a balanced effect that favored neither the intervention nor the comparison. Cost, resources, and equity were considered varied. CONCLUSION: The RPG panel provided two conditional recommendations and suggested (1) against using ketamine as monotherapy analgo-sedation in critically ill adults on iMV when other analgo-sedatives are available; and (2) using ketamine as an adjunct to non-ketamine usual care sedatives (e.g., opioids, propofol, dexmedetomidine) or continuing with non-ketamine usual care sedatives alone. Large-scale trials should provide additional evidence.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/39207913\/"},{"pmid":39178159,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"Racial and Ethnic Differences in Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Care.","authors":"Owusu-Agyemang P; Idowu O; Muthukumar A; Guerra-Londono JJ; Idowu T; Diaz NN; Feng L; Miller M; Gundre S; Wright C; Cata JP","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic differences in health care may result in significant morbidity. The objective of this study was to determine whether there was an association between a patient's race or ethnicity and the receipt of an antiemetic agent preoperatively, during surgery, and in the recovery room.

A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to estimate the effects of covariates on antiemetic administration. RESULTS: Of the 60,595 patients included in the study, 3053 (5.0%) self-identified as Asian, 5376 (8.9%) as Black, 8431 (13.9%) as Hispanic or Latino, 42,533 (70.2%) as White, and 1202 (2.0%) as belonging to another racial or ethnic group. Multivariable analyses showed significant associations between a patient's race or ethnicity and the receipt of antiemetics in the preoperative holding area, operating room, and recovery room (all P < .001).

Despite comprising 75% of the global health workforce and dominating academic global health programs, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions in global health organizations. Our study aimed to identify potential gender differences in the beliefs and attitudes regarding barriers that women anesthesiologists encounter in pursuing careers and leadership roles in global health and to identify recommendations for improving gender equity in global health. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey focusing on career leadership opportunities and challenges uniquely faced by women clinicians in global health. We obtained permission from the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists to distribute our questionnaire to their leadership committee members during 2 months (May-July 2022). RESULTS: The questionnaire was distributed to 164 study participants with 67 individuals (44.8% female) based in 38 different countries completing the survey (response rate 40.9%). Overall, 47.8% of the participants aspired to a leadership position in global health and 58.2% agreed women face unique barriers to global health leadership (70.0% of women compared to 48.6% of men; P = .081). Female gender (odds ratio [OR], 19.22, P = .004) and divorced marital status (OR, 746.26, P = .004) were positively associated and African ethnicity (OR, 0.002, P = .017) was negatively associated with the perception of gender bias in their career growth. The main challenges included balancing work and family responsibilities, lack of female mentors or role models, gender-based discrimination, and limited opportunities for career advancement. Men acknowledged these challenges but reported personally experiencing them to a lesser extent, particularly concerning lack of opportunities ( P = .005), inadequate pay ( P = .000), and lack of training ( P = .000). CONCLUSIONS: Gender disparities exist in the pursuit of global health careers. This study underscored that more women than men perceive barriers in pursuing leadership roles in global health and that men generally encounter these obstacles to a lesser extent. Female representation in leadership positions could be supported through evidence-informed policies that promote work-life balance, improve mentorship, offer equal opportunities for career advancement and adequate pay, and combat gender-based discrimination.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/39137053\/"},{"pmid":39116012,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"Effect of In Vivo Administration of Fibrinogen Concentrate Versus Cryoprecipitate on Ex Vivo Clot Degradation in Neonates Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.","authors":"Downey LA; Moiseiwitsch N; Nellenbach K; Xiang Y; Brown AC; Guzzetta NA","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Neonates undergoing cardiac surgery require fibrinogen replacement to restore hemostasis after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Cryoprecipitate is often the first-line treatment, but recent studies demonstrate that fibrinogen concentrate (RiaSTAP; CSL Behring) may be acceptable in this population. This investigator-initiated, randomized trial compares cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen concentrate in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03932240). The primary end point was the percent change in ex vivo clot degradation from baseline at 24 hours after surgery between groups. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative blood transfusions, coagulation factor levels, and adverse events. METHODS: Neonates were randomized to receive cryoprecipitate (control group) or fibrinogen concentrate (study group) as part of a post-CPB transfusion algorithm. Blood samples were drawn at 4 time points: presurgery (T1), after treatment (T2), arrival to the intensive care unit (ICU) (T3), and 24 hours postsurgery (T4). Using the mixed-effect models, we analyzed the percent change in ex vivo clot degradation from a patient's presurgery baseline at each time point. Intraoperative blood product transfusions, coagulation factor levels, perioperative laboratory values, and adverse events were collected. RESULTS: Thirty-six neonates were enrolled (intent to treat [ITT]). Thirteen patients in the control group and seventeen patients in the study group completed the study per protocol (PP). After normalizing to the patient's own baseline (T1), no significant differences were observed in clot degradation at T2 or T3. At T4, patients in the study group had greater degradation when compared to those in the control group (826.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 291.1-1361.9 vs -545.9%, 95% CI, -1081.3 to -10.4; P < .001). Study group patients received significantly less median post-CPB transfusions than control group patients (ITT, 27.2 mL\/kg [19.0-36.9] vs 41.6 [29.2-52.4]; P = .043; PP 26.7 mL\/kg [18.8-32.2] vs 41.2 mL\/kg [29.0-51.4]; P < .001). No differences were observed in bleeding or thrombotic events. CONCLUSIONS: Neonates who received fibrinogen concentrate, as compared to cryoprecipitate, have similar perioperative ex vivo clot degradation with faster degradation at 24 hours postsurgery, less post-CPB blood transfusions, and no increased bleeding or thrombotic complications. Our findings suggest that fibrinogen concentrate adequately restores hemostasis and reduces transfusions in neonates after CPB without increased bleeding or thrombosis risk.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/39116012\/"},{"pmid":38861464,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"In Vitro Investigation of Insulin Dynamics During 4 Hours of Simulated Cardiopulmonary Bypass.","authors":"Schweizer T; Nossen CM; Galova B; Schild C; Huber M; Bally L; Vogt A; Siepe M; Nagler M; Fischer K; Guensch DP","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia is common in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. We hypothesize that intraoperative hyperglycemia may be, at least partially, attributable to insulin loss due to adhesion on artificial surfaces and\/or degradation by hemolysis. Thus, our primary aim was to investigate the loss of insulin in 2 different isolated extracorporeal circulation circuits (ECCs), that is, a conventional ECC (cECC) with a roller pump, and a mini-ECC (MiECC) system with a centrifugal pump. The secondary aim was to assess and compare the relationship between changes in insulin concentration and the degree of hemolysis in our 2 ECC models. METHODS: Six cECC and 6 MiECC systems were primed with red packed blood cells and thawed fresh-frozen plasma (1:1). Four additional experiments were performed in cECC using only thawed fresh-frozen plasma. Human insulin (Actrapid) was added, targeting a plasma insulin concentration of 400 mU\/L. Insulin concentration and hemolysis index were measured at baseline and hourly thereafter. The end points were the change in insulin level after 4 hours compared to baseline and hemolysis index after 4 hours. The insulin concentration and hemolysis index were analyzed by means of a saturated linear mixed-effect regression model with a random offset for each experiment to account for the repeated measure design of the study, resulting in mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the primary end points as well as of pairwise contrasts with respect to ECC type. RESULTS: Insulin concentration decreased by 63% (95% CI, 48%-77%) in the MiECC and 92% (95% CI, 77%-106%) in the cECC system that contained red blood cells. Insulin loss was significantly higher in the cECC system compared to the MiECC ( P = .022). In the cECC with only plasma, insulin did not significantly decrease (-4%; 95% CI, -21% to 14%). Hemolysis index in MiECC increased from 68 (95% CI, 46-91) to 76 (95% CI, 54-98) after 4 hours, in cECC from 81 (95% CI, 59-103) to 121 (95% CI, 99-143). Hemolysis index and percent change of insulin showed an excellent relationship (r = -0.99, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that insulin levels substantially decreased during 4 hours of simulated cardiopulmonary bypass only in the ECC that contained hemoglobin. The decrease was more pronounced in the cECC, which also exhibited a greater degree of hemolysis. Our results suggest that insulin degradation by hemolysis products may be a stronger contributor to insulin loss than adhesion of insulin molecules to circuit surfaces.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/38861464\/"},{"pmid":40713194,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Perioperative cardiac arrest requiring admission to intensive care units in Japan: epidemiological differences between emergency and elective surgery.","authors":"Anezaki H; Aoki Y; Kato H; Nakajima M; Kaszynski RH; Suzuki K; Yamaguchi T; Naruse S; Kimura T; Mimuro S; Nakajima Y","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Perioperative cardiac arrest is more prevalent in emergency surgery and carries substantial mortality risks; however, large-scale studies examining its incidence, aetiology, and outcomes remain scarce. This study investigated the epidemiology of perioperative cardiac arrest in emergency and elective surgeries in Japan. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study using the Japanese Intensive care PAtient Database (JIPAD), a nationwide ICU registry. Patients coming from the operating theatre who experienced cardiac arrest before ICU admission between April 2015 and March 2023 were included. Patients were categorised as undergoing emergency or elective surgery, and group comparisons were performed for the incidence, surgical procedures, aetiologies, and clinical outcomes.

Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) to the dorsal root ganglion and epidural neuroplasty techniques are emerging as alternative interventional treatments. However, there are no direct comparison studies between PRF and epidural neuroplasty, leading to uncertainty in optimal treatment selection. OBJECTIVE: This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to indirectly compare the efficacy of PRF and epidural neuroplasty techniques in managing LRP. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We conducted a systematic review and NMA of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PRF, epidural neuroplasty, and conservative treatments, including ESI and sham procedures. Data sources included PubMed, Cochrane Central, Embase, and Web of Science up to December 31, 2024. Inclusion criteria comprised RCTs evaluating adult patients with lumbar radicular pain from disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or failed back surgery syndrome. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, interventions, outcomes, and risk of bias. The primary outcome was pain reduction at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The secondary outcome was disability reduction, measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). A frequentist random-effects model was used for data synthesis, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Prediction intervals were not calculated due to data limitations, which is acknowledged as a limitation. FINDINGS: 14 RCTs comprising 1229 patients were included. At 1 month, there was no significant difference between PRF and epidural neuroplasty. At 3 months, epidural neuroplasty showed significant advantages over PRF (mean difference: -1.47, 95% CI -2.73 to -0.46); however, the certainty of evidence for this comparison was rated low. Similar trends were observed at 6 and 12 months, but the confidence in these estimates remained low to very low. For ODI, no significant differences were found at time points, and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low across comparisons. CONCLUSION: PRF and epidural neuroplasty may offer comparable long-term pain and disability outcomes for patients with lumbar radicular pain, but the overall certainty of evidence was low to very low, limiting confident clinical recommendations. These findings highlight the need for high-quality, head-to-head trials to better inform interventional treatment strategies for LRP.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40707353\/"},{"pmid":40707283,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring during noncardiac surgery: a prospective, blinded observational multicentre cohort study.","authors":"Janssen H; Dias P; Ahuja S; Alharbi S; Hiller L; Khan K; Iyer K; Sundar A; Abousharkh I; Thomas C; Jhanji S; Oliver NS; Ackland GL","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperglycaemia after noncardiac surgery is rarely detected outside of the critical care environment, yet occurs commonly and is associated with excess complications including infections and myocardial injury. Systematic, prospectively collected data regarding the accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring commenced immediately before surgery and throughout the early perioperative period are lacking. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients aged >50 yr undergoing noncardiac surgery who required at least 24 h of hospital stay. We used real-time continuous glucose monitoring (Dexcom G7 sensor, placed in the upper outer arm) (Dexcom, San Diego, CA, USA) with reference values from arterial blood glucose measurements by amperometry. The primary outcome was the overall mean difference (bias) before surgery, at end of surgery, and 24 h after surgery (Bland-Altman analysis).

Emerging research shows that adolescents who immigrated to Europe are disproportionately affected by chronic pain compared to their nonimmigrant peers. Anti-immigration attitudes, which are also rising in Europe, may contribute to this disparity by fostering social exclusion and discrimination, which can heighten psychological distress and contribute to chronic pain. Using an intersectional approach, this study examined (1) the association between country-level anti-immigration attitudes and chronic pain in immigrant adolescents and (2) whether this association differed by sex and socioeconomic status. Cross-sectional data were drawn from 5621 immigrant adolescents across 20 European countries using the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children 2018 survey. Country-level anti-immigration attitudes were obtained from the European Social Survey 2018. Weighted mixed-effects logistic regression models assessed the association between anti-immigration attitudes and chronic pain and tested for interaction effects with sex and socioeconomic status. Results showed that stronger country-level anti-immigration attitudes were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of chronic pain among immigrant adolescents (OR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.11-1.38) and that this association was stronger in immigrants with low socioeconomic status (OR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.08-1.77). Sociopolitical exclusion of immigrants may contribute to higher chronic pain rates in immigrant adolescents, especially those with lower socioeconomic status.

Opioids also cause sleep disordered breathing (SDB), which might impact pain via arousals and hypoxemia, with potential for a vicious cycle. Adults with noncancer pain using opioids daily for >3 months were recruited. Subjects underwent pain and sleep questionnaires, pain tolerance via 10 degrees C cold pressor testing, and polysomnography. Hypoxic burden was determined from polysomnographic signal analysis.

This may stem from an overreliance on reflex-based outcomes, which do not accurately reflect the spontaneous or non-evoked pain (NEP) characteristic of neuropathic pain. To bridge this gap, we evaluated the preclinical efficacy of standard analgesics in relieving NEP associated with neuropathic pain, thereby providing valuable insights that could optimize preclinical testing. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (July 2023). A random-effects model evaluated the effect of the intervention, with subgroup analyses exploring variability sources. Of the 91 included studies, 65 were eligible for meta-analysis, yielding 196 drug evaluations. Most evaluations involved traumatic nerve injury (91%) in male animals, although fewer were nontraumatic neuropathies (6%) or spinal cord injuries (4%). Standard pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain relieved NEP with efficacy patterns closely matching clinical results. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors showed the highest efficacy, followed by gabapentinoids and strong opioids, whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and mild opioids had no significant effect. Next, we confirmed that all the NEP-related behaviors were significantly alleviated by standard analgesics, validating that they are indeed pain associated. Moreover, drug efficacy was greater in traumatic nerve injury models compared with nontraumatic neuropathy models. In conclusion, standard analgesics demonstrated robust preclinical efficacy in alleviating NEP, mirroring their clinical performance. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating assessments of spontaneous pain into classical tests in preclinical studies to enhance the clinical translation of investigational analgesics.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40705707\/"},{"pmid":40705706,"journal":"Pain","title":"Familial risk of carpal tunnel syndrome among first-degree relatives and interaction with obesity and hyperglycemia-a population-based study in Korea.","authors":"Kim JE; Kim B; Kim HJ; Hwang J; Swan H; Kim YS; Cha J; Kang T; Kim KH; Kim M; Hann HJ; Kim KU; Ahn HS","abstract":"Although genetic and lifestyle factors are known to be involved in carpal tunnel syndrome development, population-level familial risk and interactions between gene and environmental factors have been scarcely studied.

We conducted a qualitative study of 16 women with endometriosis, using a very open interview technique (Grid Elaboration Method) and thematic analysis of women's accounts. We elicited 6 interrelated themes: 1 on the nature of pain; 3 on impact on everyday life, social life, and relationships, and emotions; 1 on healthcare experiences; and 1 on the burden of being female. Even when describing concerns about what was causing pain, women expressed few fears about physical integrity, nor did they avoid activities with the intention of protecting themselves from damage or increased pain. This leads us to question the applicability of the fear and avoidance model, and we encourage further exploration of the psychology of endometriosis-related pain to better design effective pain management interventions.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40705703\/"},{"pmid":40704593,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"The role of supramammillary nucleus glutamatergic neurons in modulating consciousness transitions during propofol anesthesia in mice.","authors":"Li JY; Wu YH; Wang YH; Long S; Hu R; Huang WQ; Wang ZX","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Glutamatergic neurons in the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) have previously been shown to be pivotal parts of the wakefulness\/sleep regulation system. However, whether they play a role in propofol-mediated modulation of consciousness remains unclear. This study hypothesized that glutamatergic neurons in the SuM contribute to the regulation of altered states of consciousness under propofol anesthesia in mice. METHODS: The effects of propofol anesthesia on neuronal activity were measured by calcium fiber photometry recording. Lesions and chemogenetic activation were used to investigate the role of glutamatergic neurons in the SuM in anesthesia induction, emergence, and sensitivity to propofol. Optogenetic methods were used to further explore the effects of SuM glutamatergic neurons or the projections from the SuM to the medial septum (MS) on cortical activity and behavioral changes during the maintenance of propofol anesthesia. RESULTS: Activities of glutamatergic neurons in the SuM decreased before propofol-induced loss of consciousness and rapidly increased at the onset of consciousness recovery. Chemogenetic ablation of glutamatergic neurons in the SuM reduced the induction time (mCherry vs. caspase-3, mean +\/- SD, 150.1 +\/- 25.3 s vs. 97.3 +\/- 22.2 s, P < 0.001, n = 12) and prolonged the recovery time (1536.0 +\/- 422.8 s vs. 2672.0 +\/- 1048.0 s, P < 0.001, n = 12) under propofol anesthesia. Chemogenetic activation of glutamatergic neurons in the SuM had opposite effects. Optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic neurons in the SuM or the neuronal projections from the SuM to the MS induced behavioral arousal and cortical activation during the maintenance of propofol anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Glutamatergic neurons in the SuM and their projections to the MS contribute to the regulation of altered states of consciousness under propofol anesthesia in mice.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40704593\/"},{"pmid":40704591,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"Sensory-selective peripheral and neuraxial nerve blockade with 2',6'-pipecolylxylidine.","authors":"Ostertag-Hill CA; Chen S; Xue T; Shao R; Torre M; Bin F; Vahedi Z; Chen L; Staffa SJ; Zheng Y; Kohane DS","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Safe sensory-selective local anesthetics would be a major advance in the management of acute and chronic pain. Here we describe the sensory-selective local anesthetic properties and the toxicity profile of a known metabolite of amino-amide local anesthetics, 2',6'-pipecolylxylidine (PPX). METHODS: PPX was synthesized and made into its hydrochloride salt. PPX or ropivacaine (ROP) were injected at the sciatic nerve or intrathecally in rats, who then underwent modified hotplate (sensory) testing and weight-bearing (motor) testing. Rats injected with PPX or ROP were assessed for clinical toxicity endpoints. Conduction blockade was studied with single-unit recordings in mice. Biocompatibility was assessed histologically. RESULTS: In male rats, sciatic sensory and motor block from 15 mM ROP lasted ~150 min; sensory nerve block from 30 mM PPX lasted 67.4 +\/- 17.4 min without motor block. Addition of chemical permeation enhancers to 30 mM PPX abolished sensory selectivity. Intrathecal 15 mM ROP produced sensory and motor block lasting ~15 min; sensory block from 30 mM PPX lasted 24.8 +\/- 8.7 min without motor block; repeated injection caused continuous sensory-selective block. In female rats, sciatic nerve blocks with ROP were similar to blocks in males, while blocks with PPX were sensory-selective but higher PPX concentrations were required. Ex vivo, 1.5 mM ROP caused reversible block of Adelta and C-fibers; 15 mM PPX blocked Adelta- but not C-fibers. Systemic 39.0 +\/- 1.8 mg\/kg ROP caused severe clinical toxicity; 75.3 +\/- 3.2 mg\/kg PPX caused none. Tissue reaction to PPX was benign, comparable to that of ROP. CONCLUSIONS: PPX provides sensory-selective local and neuraxial anesthesia with a good safety profile. The sensory selectivity may be attributable to the particular hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance of PPX.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40704591\/"},{"pmid":40702899,"journal":"European journal of anaesthesiology","title":"Incidence of transient sinus pause in cardiac rhythm increases with the use of hyperangulated videolaryngoscope blade compared to standard angle blade during tracheal intubation: A prospective randomised controlled trial.","authors":"Lee YJ; Lee S; Kim JW; Oh CS; Kim TY","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The hyperanglulated videolaryngoscope blade may exert different forces on the larynx compared to the standard angle blade, potentially leading to haemodynamic changes, particularly in cardiac rhythm. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the hyperangulated blade on haemodynamic changes during tracheal intubation. DESIGN: A prospective randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Tertiary, university hospital, single centre. PATIENTS: A total of 134 patients scheduled for general anaesthesia were included in the final analysis. INTERVENTION: Tracheal intubation using either a standard angle videolaryngoscope blade (Standard group) or a hyperangulated blade (Hyperangulated group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The occurrence of a transient decrease in heart rate or a transient sinus pause during tracheal intubation was recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of transient sinus pause was significantly higher in the Hyperangulated group compared to the Standard group (19% vs. 4%, respectively, P = 0.009). The percentage of the glottic opening score was significantly higher, and the incidence of backward, upward, and rightward pressure was significantly lower in the Hyperangulated group. The incidences of direct epiglottis lifting was significantly higher in the Hyperangulated group, and the total length of time of the blade in the mouth was significantly longer in the Hyperangulated group. Multivariate logistic analysis identified the use of a hyperangulated blade as an independent predictor of transient sinus pause during tracheal intubation (odds ratio = 5.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.53 to 21.53; P = 0.010).

However, the exact mechanisms underlying this interaction and its role in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) circuitry in pain regulation are under exploration. METHODS: We explored the role of P2X4R-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-TrkB signalling of ACC in regulating muscle pain (MP). Mechanical and thermal pain thresholds along with open field tests were used to assess pain and anxiety-like behaviours. Golgi staining, transmission electron microscopy, and patch-clamp recordings were performed to evaluate synaptic plasticity changes. Meanwhile, cFos staining and calcium imaging substantiate the neuronal excitability. In addition, we used chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to manipulate ACC neuronal activity. RESULTS: The ACC exhibited increased excitability, together with enhanced synaptic plasticity in rats with chronic MP. Microglial inhibition alleviated pain and anxiety-like behaviours. Furthermore, microglial P2X4R promoted BDNF expression, which acted on TrkB to regulate neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity in ACC; these effects were reversed by P2X4R knockdown and TrkB inhibition in MP. Chemogenetic and optogenetic suppression of ACC hyperactivity relieved chronic MP and anxiety-like behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight a critical microglia-neuronal communication via the P2X4R-BDNF-TrkB signalling, which enhances synaptic plasticity and cortical excitability in the anterior cingulate cortex, thereby participating in the regulation of muscle pain. Understanding how to assess and modulate microglia-neuronal communication and abnormal cortical activity will be key to developing novel therapies for MP disorders.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40707290\/"},{"pmid":40707288,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"DAGs for dummies: how to extract causation from correlation.","authors":"Gaskell A; Sleigh J","abstract":"Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) offer a clear, structured approach to depicting causal relationships in observational research, helping to distinguish likely causation from mere association.

Regional analgesia techniques such as thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) are effective but carry risks, whereas the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a newer, potentially safer alternative. We compared the efficacy of ESPB and PVB for managing acute pain after major breast cancer surgery. METHODS: This prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blind trial involved 292 women who underwent major breast surgery. Patients were randomised to receive either ESPB or PVB. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants requiring morphine within the first 2 h after surgery, and the secondary outcomes included pain scores, morphine consumption, complications, and participants satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 75.2% and 50.3% of the participants in the ESPB and PVB groups, respectively, required morphine, and the noninferiority criterion for ESPB was not met. However, morphine consumption was similar between the groups. Pain scores were greater in the ESPB group, especially during mobilisation, and ESPB provided less reliable dermatomal coverage than PVB, with the required area was not covered in 55.9% of participants in the ESPB group compared with 20.4% of participants in the PVB group. Satisfaction was similar between groups, with participants in both groups reporting high satisfaction. No major complications were observed.

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy decreases postoperative work of breathing and provides a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) effect. As a result, it may decrease the occurrence of diaphragmatic dysfunction and PPCs after thoracic surgery. METHODS: Single-centre, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy were randomized to receive conventional oxygen therapy (COT) or high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. In both groups, inspiratory oxygen fraction was titrated to reach a peripheral oxygen saturation of >94 %. Diaphragmatic displacement (DD) and diaphragmatic thickening fraction (TF%) were measured 2 and 24 h after surgery. Diaphragmatic dysfunction was identified by DD <10 mm. PPCs occurring within 7 days after study enrollment were recorded. RESULTS: We analyzed 116 patients in the study. Postoperative diaphragmatic dysfunction occurred in 17\/58 patients (29 %) in the HFNC group compared to 21\/58 (36 %) in the COT group (p = 0.55). The rate of PPCs was similar between the two groups: 32\/58 (55 %) in the HFNC group and 37\/58 (64 %) in the COT group (p = 0.449).

Our findings demonstrate that only simultaneous activation of both nociceptive and nonnociceptive fibers induces sustained hypersensitivity and a spinal microglia response. This response is characterized by increased cell proliferation, altered electrophysiological profile with hyperpolarized membrane potential, increased potassium currents, and a less ramified morphology. In contrast, activation of nociceptive or nonnociceptive fibers alone does not induce these changes. In addition, inhibiting spinal microglia with minocycline prevents those changes.

SIRT1 overexpression in CeA glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons effectively alleviated peripheral nerve injury-induced depression-related behavior in mice. Moreover, peripheral nerve injury induced significant neuronal excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance in CeA, manifested by the increased glutamatergic neuronal excitability and decreased GABAergic neuronal excitability in SNI mice. SIRT1 overexpression in CeA glutamatergic neurons decreased glutamatergic neuronal activity without influence on GABAergic neuronal activity, while SIRT1 overexpression in CeA GABAergic neurons increased GABAergic neuronal activity and reduced glutamatergic neuronal activity in SNI mice. Moreover, optogenetic induction of neuronal E-I imbalance in CeA by activating glutamatergic neurons or inhibiting GABAergic neurons reversed the improvement of peripheral nerve injury-induced depression-related behavior by SIRT1 overexpression. These findings suggest that the dysfunction of SIRT1 is related to the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced depression-related behavior by decreasing GABAergic neuronal excitability and enhancing glutamatergic neuronal excitability, leading to the neuronal E-I imbalance in CeA.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the postoperative pain scores in patients who received liposomal bupivacaine via brachial plexus block were identified. The primary outcome was resting pain scores (Numerical Rating Scale, 0-10) at 24 hours after nerve block injection derived from the random effects model.

However, it remains unclear whether there are common molecular features associated with chronic itch, and whether these features are selective for chronic itch compared to chronic pain. To identify potential genes or molecular characteristics that are specifically associated with chronic itch, we examined transcriptomic data from sensory neurons collected from 3 mouse models of chronic itch and a monkey model of contact dermatitis. We compared these data to transcriptomic data from 3 mouse models of pain and clinical data from patients with neuropathic pain. Our analyses revealed that the upregulation of Nppb expression in sensory neurons is consistently associated with models of itch, but not with models of pain. Further, our cellular characterization showed that the increased expression of Nppb arises from increased cell-autonomous expression rather than the recruitment of Nppb expression in other classes of sensory neurons. Given that Nppb is a well-established itch neurotransmitter, our findings suggest that the increased expression of Nppb in sensory neurons may contribute to chronic itch.

Contrary to the MoCA and Mini-Cog, CI on the AD8 was associated with higher all-cause complications (15.1 % vs. 3.7 %, P = 0.003), emergency department visits (11.3 % vs. 2.5 %, P = 0.007), and composite adverse outcomes (15.1 % vs. 4.6 %, P = 0.008) at 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the AD8 and Mini-Cog demonstrated comparable diagnostic accuracy for CI, the AD8 provided additional insights into preoperative patient-centered assessments and 90-day adverse outcomes. Our study emphasizes the importance of preoperative screening for CI, highlighting the AD8 as a valuable tool.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40694882\/"},{"pmid":40691088,"journal":"Regional anesthesia and pain medicine","title":"The impact of local anesthetic systemic toxicity advisories on reporting to the National Poison Data System (NPDS).","authors":"Fettiplace M; Weinberg G; Nixon H; Barabanova A; Chiang C; Gitman M","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: In 2010, multiple anesthesia societies introduced recommendations for treating local anesthetic systemic toxicity, but the impact of those recommendations is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that reports of local anesthetic-related poisoning and mortality have declined since the publication of advisories in 2010. METHODS: We analyzed reports of local anesthetic poisoning and mortality from the American Poison Centers National Poison Data System (NPDS) spanning 1983-2022. We conducted a case-non-case disproportionality analysis using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) to evaluate the effect of the 2010 recommendations on reports of poisoning and death to the NPDS by comparing reports of poisoning and death from 2011 to 2022 relative to 2001-2010. Multiple linear regression and Poisson regression were used for confirmation, together with exploratory analyses of individual cases of mortality. RESULTS: In the decade following the introduction of recommendations (2011-2022), reports of local anesthetic poisoning decreased relative the prior decade (2001-2010, ROR=0.77, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.78, p<0.0001), driven by a decrease in non-lidocaine-related reports. Conversely, reports of lidocaine poisoning and reports of lidocaine mortality increased after 2010 (ROR=2.7 95% CI 1.3 to 5.6, p=0.0094). Case analysis revealed a decrease in reports of death in the operating room from 47% before 2010 to 15% after 2010, but an increase in reports of death from intravenous lidocaine delivery (3% to 27%, respectively). DISCUSSION: The decrease in poisoning reports aligns with the implementation of professional recommendations and advancements, such as ultrasound-guided nerve blocks and lipid emulsion therapy. However, the rise in reports of lidocaine-related deaths-primarily in emergency settings-underscores significant risks. These findings emphasize the need for improved guidance on lidocaine use and dosing strategies to prevent lidocaine-related mortality.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40691088\/"},{"pmid":40690383,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"Prevalence of Point-of-Care Ultrasound Abnormalities and Raised Serum NT-proBNP in Early-Onset Preeclampsia.","authors":"Fantin RL; Uys F; Schuetz T; Flint M; Lombard CJ; Matjila MJ; Osman A; Swanevelder JL; Dyer RA; Ortner CM","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. A previous study in patients with late-onset preeclampsia (LOPE), showed an association between pulmonary interstitial syndrome (PIS), detected by lung ultrasound, and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). In early onset preeclampsia (EOPE); however, the cardiopulmonary status remains poorly characterized. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study enrolled women with EOPE with severe features. Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) assessments included lung ultrasound, TTE, and sonographic assessment of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). PIS was defined as the presence of bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound. An ONSD >5.8 mm was considered compatible with raised intracranial pressure. Serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and albumin levels were measured. The primary aim was to assess the association between PIS and elevated LVEDP in EOPE. Secondary aims included assessing the prevalence of POCUS abnormalities in EOPE and their association with serum NT-proBNP and albumin levels, and comparing the results with historical data from patients with LOPE. RESULTS: Sixty-4 patients completed the study. There was no association between PIS and elevated LVEDP (P = .53). PIS, diastolic dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and elevated LVEDP were observed in 23% (95% CI, 14.4-35.4%), 52% (95% CI, 39.3-63.8%), 30% (95% CI, 19.9-42.5%), and 35% (95% CI, 24.2-47.6%) of women, respectively. Increased ONSD was noted in 2 women (3%). Median (IQR) NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated (278 [119-678] ng\/L) and associated with PIS (P = .015) and elevated LVEDP (P = .003). Using a threshold for NT-proBNP of 125 ng\/L, the sensitivity and specificity for predicting PIS were 93.3% and 34%, and for increased LVEDP, 90.5% and 40%, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed limited diagnostic value of NT-proBNP for PIS (AUC = 0.78) and for elevated LVEDP (AUC = 0.68). No association was found between serum albumin and PIS, systolic dysfunction, or elevated LVEDP. The prevalence of systolic dysfunction was significantly higher (P < .01) and raised ONSD lower (P < .01) than in historical controls with LOPE. CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound and TTE showed a high prevalence of PIS, systolic dysfunction, and raised LVEDP in women diagnosed with EOPE. PIS was not associated with elevated LVEDP. NT-proBNP level was significantly associated with PIS and elevated LVEDP, however clinical predictive value was limited.

We conducted a randomized trial to assess whether high-flow nasal oxygen is noninferior to mechanical ventilation through a laryngeal mask in terms of success rate of intraoperative respiratory support among patients undergoing a 30-minute general anesthesia session. METHODS: Single-center, randomized, noninferiority trial conducted in Italy between May 2022 and June 2023 and involving American Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II patients undergoing general anesthesia for operative hysteroscopy. Participants were randomized to receive laryngeal mask ventilation (volume-controlled ventilation to obtain end-tidal carbon dioxide between 35 and 45 mm Hg, inhaled oxygen fraction to achieve peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 95%) or high-flow nasal oxygen (70 L per minute, inhaled oxygen fraction of 100%) for intraoperative respiratory support. Patients received general anesthesia with propofol target-controlled infusion without neuromuscular blockade. Primary outcome was intraoperative respiratory support success rate, which was defined as peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 94% and transcutaneous carbon dioxide lower than 65 mm Hg with no need for rescue airway interventions for the entire procedure. Secondary outcomes included the rate of airway-related complications (including need for bag-mask or laryngeal mask ventilation, or tracheal intubation), postoperative respiratory symptoms, and postoperative dyspnea. RESULTS: All 180 patients who were randomized completed the trial (90 patients in each group). Median [interquartile range] anesthesia duration was 25 [20-36] minutes in high-flow group and 32 minutes [27-44] in the laryngeal mask group. Intraoperative respiratory support was successful in 89 patients (99%) in both groups (absolute difference 0, unilateral 95% confidence interval, 3%, noninferiority P < .001). Incidence of postoperative respiratory symptoms was significantly lower in high-flow versus laryngeal mask group (2% vs 19%, P < .001), while airway-related complications and postoperative dyspnea were not different. Intraoperative transcutaneous carbon dioxide was significantly higher in high-flow group, with 43% of patients showing values greater than 55 mm Hg.

The recruitment-to-inflation ratio (R\/I) is measured from ventilator data during a single-breath PEEP-release maneuver, and has been proposed to assess recruitability without the need for additional equipment during acute respiratory distress syndrome. This study hypothesized that R\/I reliably estimates the individual potential for lung recruitment during general anesthesia. METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing open abdominal surgery received mechanical ventilation with PEEP=12 cmH 2 O for thirty minutes, which was then abruptly reduced to 2 cmH 2 O. Finally, a decremental PEEP trial was performed to measure collapse and overdistension at each level. Gas exchange, end-tidal CO 2 , respiratory mechanics by ventilator waveform analysis, regional overdistension and collapse by electrical impedance tomography, end-expiratory lung volume and functional residual capacity by nitrogen dilution were measured. R\/I was calculated during the single-breath derecruitment maneuver from ventilator data. RESULTS: R\/I (median=0.41, range=0-0.86) was linearly correlated with recruited volume normalized to functional residual capacity measured by gas dilution (r=0.48, slope=0.27 [0.03, 0.52]), and recruited volume scaled to PEEP-induced inflation volume measured by tomography (r=0.82, slope=1.2 [0.77, 1.64]). Compared to patients with R\/I<\/=0.40 (n=10), those with R\/I>0.40 (n=10) required higher PEEP to optimize regional mechanics and balance collapse and overdistension (median [Q1, Q3]: 10 [8, 11] cmH 2 O vs. 8 [7, 9], p=0.03), showed decreases in dead space (-2 [-5, 1] % vs. 3 [0, 5] %, p=0.013) and greater reductions in collapse (-44 [-31, -47] % vs. -30 [-20, -38] % , p=0.016) and dynamic lung strain (-0.06 [-0.09, -0.05] vs. -0.04 [-0.05, -0.02], p=0.04) with higher PEEP.

The erector spinae plane, pericapsular nerve group and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks offer motor-sparing analgesia of the hip region but target different areas. We designed this study to compare the pericapsular nerve group block combined with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block with the erector spinae plane block in terms of postoperative analgesia and motor impairment. METHODS: Our study involved patients undergoing primary elective unilateral total hip arthroplasty. All patients received spinal anaesthesia and standardised peri-operative multimodal analgesia. Patients were assigned at random to either pericapsular nerve group and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks ('anterior' block group) or erector spinae plane block ('posterior' block group). The primary outcome was intravenous morphine consumption within the first 24 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included: pain scores; assessment of sensory and motor block; incidence of complications; and incidence of chronic postsurgical pain. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients completed the study. The study groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. There was no difference in morphine consumption at 24 h between patients allocated to the anterior and posterior block groups (median (IQR [range]) 5 (1-10 [0-22]) mg vs. 5 (2-8.5 [0-20]) mg, respectively; p > 0.99). Incidence of motor block was 1\/31 for patients allocated to the anterior block group compared with 5\/31 for those allocated to the posterior block group (p = 0.09). There were no differences in any of the secondary outcome measures between groups. DISCUSSION: We found no statistically or clinically relevant difference between two motor-sparing peripheral regional analgesic techniques among patients undergoing primary elective total hip arthroplasty with multimodal analgesia. Appropriate choice of block may be situation-dependent, and physicians should consider patient and system factors when selecting a technique.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40689673\/"},{"pmid":40489632,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"Clinical and Genetic Factors Associated with Intraoperative Minimum Alveolar Concentration Ratio: A Single-center Retrospective Cohort and Genome-wide Association Study.","authors":"Douville NJ; Jewell ES; Zhao X; Colquhoun DA; Bertucci-Richter E; Zollner S; Davis RP; Kumar SS; Mashour GA","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is a standard dosing metric for general anesthesia. Although influences of MAC have been identified in controlled studies, the determinants of clinical delivery of MAC ratio are largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, the authors performed this single-center retrospective study. The primary objective was to understand factors associated with MAC ratio, as indexed by the end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration, for a given case. It was hypothesized that mean arterial pressure (MAP) was strongly associated with anesthetic delivery; a secondary objective was to perform a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with MAC ratio in clinical practice. METHODS: The primary outcome was mean age-adjusted MAC ratio during the maintenance phase of anesthesia. The primary exposure variable was mean MAP during the same time window. The correlation between the outcome, exposure, and a variety of demographic, laboratory, procedural, and anesthetic covariates was assessed in adjusted multivariable linear regressions. Next, the authors performed two genome-wide association studies of clinically delivered MAC ratio. RESULTS: Of the 30,125 cases included in the final dataset, mean +\/- SD age-adjusted MAC ratio was 1.066 +\/- 0.173, and mean MAP was 82 +\/- 10 mmHg. MAP was associated with MAC ratio in the overall model (beta = 0.0028; 95% CI, 0.0024 to 0.0032; P < 0.0001). A variety of demographic ( e.g. , female sex: beta = -0.0182; 95% CI, -0.0219 to -0.0144; P < 0.0001), laboratory, surgical, and anesthetic factors were also associated with anesthetic agent concentration. Eight variants located near six genes ( DPH6 , CPM , EEFSEC , SGSM1 , CDH9 , and DISC1 ) reached the lower suggestive threshold ( P < 1 x 10 -6 ) in one but not both models; none exceed the threshold for genome-wide significance ( P < 5 x 10 -8 ). CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was verified that MAP was associated with clinical delivery of MAC ratio. The authors also characterized practice patterns of inhalational anesthetic management and identified numerous covariates that need to be accounted for when modeling anesthetic requirements. Female patients received lower doses of anesthetic, despite evidence that they have a higher requirement. While genome-wide association studies failed to identify novel variants at the level of genome-wide significance ( P < 5 x 10 -8 ), multiple mechanistically plausible genes were suggested. Notably, the DISC1 gene has been shown to impact resting-state brain activations under general anesthesia with isoflurane and has been linked to abnormal sleep\/wake patterns.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40489632\/"},{"pmid":40685291,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Predicting arterial pressure without prejudice: towards effective hypotension prediction models.","authors":"Vistisen ST; Elbers P","abstract":"Selection bias has been identified in hypotension prediction models, but its impact on an algorithm's ability to learn relevant information from the arterial waveform remains unclear.

Two similar quantitative EEG devices, BIS and Entropy, have been shown to require muscle activity (EMG) to generate accurate index values in awake individuals. Without EMG, these devices produce misleadingly low values and incorrectly suggest sedation or anaesthesia despite the cortical EEG showing the subjects are awake. As EMG affects frequency bands used by Conox, it too could be incorporating muscle activity to generate high values in awake individuals. METHODS: We replayed EEGs recorded during awake paralysis to the Conox monitor via an electronic playback system to test whether it requires EMG to generate accurate values in awake subjects. RESULTS: Both qCON and qNOX decreased after neuromuscular block to values consistent with sedation or anaesthesia, despite subjects being fully awake. qCON decreased below 60 in 15 of 19 trials, and qNOX decreased below 60 in 11 of 19 trials. Overall, 42% of qCON values during paralysis were <60, the level supposedly indicating anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Conox requires muscle activity to generate accurate values in awake individuals. Consequently, it might be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs. Studies conducted without neuromuscular block can provide misleading guidance when applied to Conox use in paralysed patients. Clinicians should approach manufacturer guidelines with caution and not rely solely on index values to guide dosing of anaesthetic drugs.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40683805\/"},{"pmid":40682867,"journal":"Journal of clinical anesthesia","title":"Electroencephalographic changes related to cortico-subcortical decoupling during propofol-induced loss of consciousness: A secondary analysis of a prospective observational study.","authors":"Fernandez-Candil JL; Nuttall R; Gallart L; Schneider G; Blanco-Hinojo L; Martinez-Vilavella G; Pujol J; Adalid I; Berger S; Bujosa D; Deus J; Gambus PL; Jaramillo S; Molto L; Ortega JF; Pacreu S; Perez-Sola V; Vila E","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cortico-subcortical decoupling has been observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during slow propofol-induced loss of consciousness (LOC). However, corresponding electroencephalography (EEG) free of the cardioballistic and fMRI artifacts is essential for translating decoupling observations to clinical monitoring. OBJECTIVE: To describe artifact-corrected EEG changes corresponding to cortico-subcortical decoupling at LOC. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary-care hospital, data collection from June 2017 to January 2019. PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen healthy volunteers receiving a targeted propofol infusion. INTERVENTIONS: Frontal EEG was recorded synchronously with clinical signs and fMRI. Gradient artifact correction was based on iterative peak detection. Cardioballistic artifact correction was accomplished with a recently described algorithmic method based on peak detection combined with temporal constraints. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The qCON index and frontal EEG before and after decoupling at LOC. RESULTS: Algorithm-filtered EEG tracings were suitable for analysis in 16 subjects. Propofol-induced LOC was achieved at a median (IQR) target plasma concentration of 4.5 (3.91 to 4.61) mug\/mL and an effect-site concentration of 4.0 (2.94 to 4.31) mug\/mL. The qCON index remained over 80 before decoupling and gradually decreased to values below 60 afterwards. Frontal alpha band power increased significantly from a median of 0.07 (0.03 to 0.15) 30 s before decoupling to 0.48 (0.08 to 0.58) 30 s after decoupling (p < 0.001).

Thus a systematic and accurate prediction strategy is needed for efficient blood utilisation and timely administration. We developed and validated a nomogram to predict intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. METHODS: We developed a nomogram that integrates preoperative variables to predict intraoperative RBC transfusion in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery at a tertiary care hospital (2012-21). The model was externally validated with datasets from other tertiary hospitals and an open dataset. Variables were selected using least absolute shrinkage or selection operator logistic regression. Discriminative ability was assessed with C-statistic, and calibration plots were used to evaluate the agreement between predicted and observed outcomes. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 128 749 patients for model development and 71 590 and 3701 patients in two external validation sets, respectively. Intraoperative RBC transfusion occurred in 6.0% of patients in the development set, and in 4.5% and 7.3% of patients in the two validation sets, respectively. The nomogram incorporated seven preoperative variables including age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, European Society of Cardiology surgical risk, haemoglobin, concentration, platelet number, international normalised ratio, and albumin concentration.

These experiences can lead to mental health challenges and affect clinicians' ability to provide care. However, the literature regarding specific factors of clinical events that cause emotional distress is limited, and their impact remains understudied. The objectives were to explore elements within anesthesiologists' practice environment contributing to distress associated with clinical events and elicit emotions and symptoms regarding clinical events that are distressing long-term. METHODS: Anesthesiology faculty members at an academic institution were invited to engage in 30-minute individual qualitative interviews. They were prompted to reflect on a clinical event that caused them lasting emotional distress. Questions were based on risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder, focusing on two time periods: during the event and after it. To maintain study rigor, a trustworthiness framework was used that emphasized four components: transferability, dependability, credibility, and confirmability. A thematic analysis approach with two coders followed, with an audit trail maintained throughout. RESULTS: Twenty anesthesiology faculty members representing nine anesthesiology subspecialties were interviewed. Risk factors leading to emotional distress represented three areas: the clinical event, context, and patient. Clinical-related risk factors included clinical errors, a physician's first time encountering a clinical scenario, lack of adequate clinical support, and unexpected outcomes. Contextual risk factors involved legal and professional repercussions, mistreatment by non-anesthesiology colleagues, personal stress, and unsupportive leadership. Patient-related risk factors included having developed a close relationship with the patient, a patient's similarity to the clinician or their loved ones, and young patient age. Participants described emotions such as sadness, guilt, shame, helplessness, and self-doubt, and physical symptoms of emotional stress, flashbacks, and intrusive thoughts. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesiologists experience profound and lasting emotional impacts from challenging clinical events. Future research should evaluate interventions to mitigate these impacts on anesthesiologists' mental health and career longevity.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40674546\/"},{"pmid":40674264,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"Remote Continuous Vital Sign Monitoring of Scoliosis Surgery Patients on General Wards: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.","authors":"Trentino KM; Hoque ME; Lloyd A; Trentino L; Ienco R; Murray K; Bowles T; Wulff S; Burcham J; Thompson A; Waterer G","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Scoliosis surgery patients often require continuous postoperative monitoring in intensive care (ICU) or high-dependency units (HDU).

STUDY POPULATION: Paediatric patients undergoing elective adenoidectomy and\/or tonsillectomy. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either methylprednisolone 1 mg kg-1 (group M) or a placebo (group C) with anaesthesia induction. Neuromuscular block was induced with rocuronium, monitored using acceleromyography and reversed with sugammadex 2 mg kg-1 at the end of surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEAURES: The primary outcome was the reversal time of rocuronium by sugammadex: time from sugammadex administration at train of four (TOF) count = 2 to a TOF ratio of >\/=0.9 of baseline. Secondary outcomes included extubation time (time from sugammadex administration at TOF count = 2 to extubation), postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting scores, and incidence of adverse events (stridor, hoarseness, severe cough and desaturation). RESULTS: At 89 +\/- 20.3 s, the reversal time of rocuronium by sugammadex was statistically significantly longer in group M compared with the 54.6 +\/- 9.3 s of group C (P < 0.001). The mean with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference was 34.5 (27.3 to 41.6) s. The extubation time was also significantly prolonged in group M compared with group C: 426.8 +\/- 134.4 vs. 331.3 +\/- 129.0 s (P = 0.002) with a difference of 95.5 (95% CI, 36.8 to 154.2) s. No significant differences were observed in postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting scores, or frequency of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Although methylprednisolone administration resulted in a significantly prolonged reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block by sugammadex and subsequent delayed extubation, the clinical importance of this interaction is minor.

PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty-one patients, with an expected waiting time before surgery of 6 weeks or more, completed the study. Excluded were those with functional, anatomical or cognitive impairment; cardiac instability; dynamic left ventricle outflow tract obstruction or proven exercise-induced arrhythmias. INTERVENTION: Four to six weeks of a multimodal prehabilitation programme, including exercise training, psychological and nutritional support. MAIN OUTCOME: Incidence of postoperative complications.

Unfortunately, the optimal combinations of pain medications to use with perioperative MMA remain uncertain. Our goal was to estimate the treatment effect of MMA on postoperative pain and opioid use and identify optimal non-opioid medication combinations to enhance MMA benefits. METHODS: The study population includes all patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery with general anesthesia between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2022 at six geographically similar Veterans Health Administration hospitals. An instrumental variable (IV) analysis was conducted using the anesthesiologist as the instrument to emulate randomization to receiving specific pain medication combinations. Outcomes were self-reported pain and opioid use after surgery. RESULTS: Of the 23 238 procedures included in the study, 46.1% received MMA. MMA was more common in younger patients, females and those with a lower probability of mortality. With IV analysis, inpatients with MMA required 6.8 fewer oral morphine equivalents (OMEs, 95% CI -10.2, to -3.4) in the postoperative period, and outpatients with MMA reported postoperative pain scores that were, on average, 1.0 unit lower than patients who did not receive MMA (95% CI -1.6 to -0.4). Combinations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) plus dexamethasone or regional anesthesia resulted in the greatest reductions in postoperative opioid use (mean reduction -29.5 OMEs, 95% CI -36.9 to -19.5 and mean reduction -28.4 OMEs, 95% CI -40.1 to -16.8, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings further support existing evidence on the effectiveness of MMA in reducing postoperative pain and opioid use following non-cardiac surgery. Importantly, our study highlights that dexamethasone and NSAIDs, not acetaminophen, which is almost universally used in MMA regimens, resulted in the greatest reduction of postoperative pain and postoperative opioid use. This has significant implications for the continued use of NSAIDs and dexamethasone in MMA protocols and underscores the need for future studies exploring the independent effect of intravenous acetaminophen on postoperative pain.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40659442\/"},{"pmid":39837579,"journal":"Regional anesthesia and pain medicine","title":"ASRA Pain Medicine consensus practice infection control guidelines for regional anesthesia and pain medicine.","authors":"Provenzano DA; Hanes M; Hunt C; Benzon HT; Grider JS; Cawcutt K; Doshi TL; Hayek S; Hoelzer B; Johnson RL; Kalagara H; Kopp S; Loftus RW; Macfarlane AJR; Nagpal AS; Neuman SA; Pawa A; Pearson ACS; Pilitsis J; Sivanesan E; Sondekoppam RV; Van Zundert J; Narouze S","abstract":"BACKGROUND: To provide recommendations on risk mitigation, diagnosis and treatment of infectious complications associated with the practice of regional anesthesia, acute and chronic pain management. METHODS: Following board approval, in 2020 the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA Pain Medicine) commissioned evidence-based guidelines for best practices for infection control. More than 80 research questions were developed and literature searches undertaken by assigned working groups comprising four to five members. Modified US Preventive Services Task Force criteria were used to determine levels of evidence and certainty. Using a modified Delphi method, >50% agreement was needed to accept a recommendation for author review, and >75% agreement for a recommendation to be accepted. The ASRA Pain Medicine Board of Directors reviewed and approved the final guidelines. RESULTS: After documenting the incidence and infectious complications associated with regional anesthesia and interventional pain procedures including implanted devices, we made recommendations regarding the role of the anesthesiologist and pain physician in infection control, preoperative patient risk factors and management, sterile technique, equipment use and maintenance, healthcare setting (office, hospital, operating room), surgical technique, postoperative risk reduction, and infection symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Consensus recommendations were based on risks associated with different settings and procedures, and keeping in mind each patient's unique characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations are intended to be multidisciplinary guidelines for clinical care and clinical decision-making in the regional anesthesia and chronic interventional pain practice.

We evaluated the carbon footprint of inhalation anaesthesia at a US academic medical centre over time and determined the relative importance of institutional measures (removal of desflurane and limiting fresh gas flow [FGF] and nitrous oxide [N(2)O] use) to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO(2)e-emissions). METHODS: From 124 428 patients undergoing inhalational anaesthesia between 2014 and 2022, CO(2)e-emissions per patient were calculated from minute-by-minute recordings of inspiratory concentrations of sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, and N(2)O, as well as FGF data. Data were combined with the global warming potential for each gas. Interrupted time series analysis, adjusted for patient and procedural factors, was applied to assess the impact of gradual removal of desflurane from operating rooms in June 2018 and its complete elimination in January 2020. RESULTS: From June 2014 to June 2022, mean CO(2)e-emissions per patient decreased by 82.8% from an average of 83.1 (median, 23.6 [interquartile range, 10.1-107.8]) kg to 14.3 (median 8.5 [4.2-15.9]) kg. In adjusted analyses, restrictive use of desflurane (-1.53 kg per patient, 95% confidence interval, -1.88 to -1.18; P<0.001) and its subsequent elimination (additional -0.50 kg per patient, -0.80 to -0.19; P=0.002) reduced CO(2)e-emissions. Before the elimination, desflurane was the main contributor to CO(2)e-emissions (74% relative contribution). After the elimination, use of N(2)O (73%) and high FGF (>3.42 L min(-1), 4%) emerged as dominant predictors of CO(2)e-emissions. CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating desflurane led to a substantial reduction in anaesthesia-related CO(2)e-emissions of  approximately 900 metric tonnes annually.

Existing questionnaires often lack patient input on item generation, are too lengthy, or were developed in culturally distinct regions. This study aimed to determine patient-perceived high-quality anaesthesia care and develop a short, validated questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with peri-anaesthesia care in Switzerland. METHODS: The Swiss Perception of Quality in Anaesthesia questionnaire was developed and validated in two university hospitals in German-speaking Switzerland. A total of 245 patients identified and ranked 42 attributes of high-quality anaesthesia care, leading to the development of key themes using a six-stage thematic analysis. The final questionnaire was tested for reliability and validity with an additional 350 patients. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: communication during the pre-anaesthetic consultation, side-effects and adverse events, and the interpersonal and professional skills of the anaesthesia team. Test-retest reliability confirmed response consistency. Dimensionality analysis showed strong correlations between overall satisfaction and other item scores (0.68 and 0.74). A three-dimensional model demonstrated a very good fit: Tucker-Lewis Index of 0.977, comparative fit index of 0.985 (both range from 0 to 1; values closer to 1 indicate better fit), root mean squared error of approximation of 0.039 (values below 0.06 suggest good fit), and standardised root mean square residual of 0.04 (values below 0.08 suggest good fit).

We have reported that STIM1 is expressed in nociceptors. However, its functional significance remains unclear. Here, we show that STIM1 plays an important role in sensing cold, chemical, and noxious mechanical stimuli in both male and female mice. We found that activation of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) triggers ER Ca2+ release, STIM1 translocation, and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Immunostaining and western blot results reveal that TRPA1 is expressed in the ER. In addition, STIM1 deficiency in the primary sensory neurons reduces cold-, allyl isothiocyanate (TRPA1 agonist)-, and bradykinin-induced Ca2+ entry and nociception. Moreover, intraplantar injection of thapsigargin, an ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, evokes nociception and increases pain hypersensitivity, which is significantly attenuated in STIM1 conditional knockout or L3\/L4 dorsal root ganglia STIM1 knockdown mice. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that STIM1-mediated SOCE increases neuronal excitability and decreases potassium channel Kv4-mediated outward currents in small to medium-sized dorsal root ganglion neurons, which is abolished by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase\/extracellular receptor kinase pathway. Our findings demonstrate that STIM1 acts as a transducer of nociception and uncover a novel link between STIM1 and TRPA1ER. Our study also provides new insights into TRPA1-mediated nociception.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40668026\/"},{"pmid":40668025,"journal":"Pain","title":"Androgen receptors expressed in the primary sensory neurons regulate mechanical pain sensitivity.","authors":"Saika F; Uta D; Fukazawa Y; Hino Y; Hatano Y; Kishioka S; Nawa H; Hino S; Suzuki K; Kiguchi N","abstract":"The expression of hormonal receptors in pain-processing regions complicates understanding the hormonal effects on pain mechanisms. This study investigates androgen receptor (AR) involvement in pain sensitivity and sex differences in pain perception. Mechanical pain thresholds were higher in normal male mice compared to gonadectomized (GDX) male and normal female mice, correlating with serum testosterone levels. In the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), AR was expressed in normal males but undetectable in GDX males and normal females. Androgen receptor overlapped with NeuN, a neuronal nuclei marker, indicating androgen signaling activation in sensory neurons. In male sensory neuron-selective AR conditional knockout (AR-cKO) mice, mechanical pain thresholds were significantly lower than in wild-type males, with the greatest AR depletion in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)+ neurons. Electrophysiological analyses revealed increased excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons in both GDX males and AR-cKO males. In female mice, administration of testosterone propionate or dihydrotestosterone significantly raised mechanical pain thresholds, accompanied by increased AR expression in the DRG. This effect was abolished in AR-cKO females, where AR depletion was most prominent in CGRP+ neurons, consistent with male findings. These results indicate that primary sensory neurons, particularly CGRP+ neurons, are critical targets of androgen in regulating mechanical pain sensitivity. Therefore, manipulating androgen signaling in sensory neurons may offer a promising approach to managing mechanical pain.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40668025\/"},{"pmid":40668023,"journal":"Pain","title":"Neurophysiological encoding of aversive prediction errors.","authors":"Gopalakrishnan R; Sonneborn C; Baillet S; Machado AG; Wager TD; Roy M","abstract":"Aversive prediction error (PE) brain signals generated by unexpected pain or pain absence are crucial for learning to avoid future pain. Yet, the detailed neurophysiological origins of PE signaling remain unclear. In this study, we combined an instrumental pain avoidance task with computational modeling and magnetoencephalography to detect time-resolved activations underlying pain expectations and aversive PE signals in the human brain. The task entailed learning probabilistically changing cue-pain associations to avoid receiving a pain stimulus. We used an axiomatic approach to identify general aversive PE signals that encode the degree to which the outcome deviated from expectations. Our findings indicate that aversive PE signals are generated in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) by the midbrain\/diencephalon, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex approximately 150 milliseconds after outcome delivery. Moreover, alpha oscillations in these regions also encoded pain expectations before the outcome. We speculate that this may facilitate the rapid generation of PEs by allowing outcome-related nociceptive activity to be integrated with ongoing predictive signals. Finally, decisions to avoid pain recruited alpha oscillations in the anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, suggesting their active engagement in comparing predicted action values. Overall, our data reveal the rapid neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the generation of aversive PEs and subsequent decision-making.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40668023\/"},{"pmid":40705695,"journal":"Pain","title":"Evaluating the efficacy of neurokinin-1 (substance P) receptor antagonist CP-99994 on facial grimacing and allodynia in mice postsurgery: a comparative study with known analgesics.","authors":"McCoy ES; Ryan DF; Park SK; Zylka MJ","abstract":"Neurokinin-1 (substance P) receptor (NK1R) antagonists failed to effectively treat pain in humans despite having antinociceptive properties in animals. Here, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of NK1R antagonist CP-99994 at reducing facial grimacing in white-coated CD-1 mice after laparotomy surgery when compared to the analgesics carprofen and buprenorphine. To enable this investigation, we developed a machine learning algorithm to automatically score facial grimacing in white-coated mice using the PainFace software platform. This algorithm detects 5 facial action units of the mouse grimace scale (MGS; orbitals, nose, ears, whiskers, cheeks) and assigns a facial grimace score (0-10) for each video frame analyzed. Carprofen and buprenorphine significantly reduced mean MGS scores and percentage of high grimace (MGS scores >\/=5) frames for up to 4 hours postsurgery across multiple doses. In contrast, CP-99994 showed limited efficacy, with only the highest 30 mg\/kg dose reducing grimacing at 2 hours. Likewise, principal component analysis of grimace data over time indicated that carprofen and buprenorphine were effective at reducing facial grimacing, whereas CP-99994 was not. However, both buprenorphine and CP-99994 reduced mechanical allodynia at the incision site. These findings reveal a dissociation between the effects of CP-99994 on a spontaneous pain measure (grimacing) and an evoked nociceptive response, whereas a known analgesic reduced both measures. Our study suggests that using facial grimacing to assess spontaneous pain alongside traditional nociceptive assays may better predict analgesic potential and possibly reduce risk of translational failures when selecting drug candidates for clinical advancement.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40705695\/"},{"pmid":40664401,"journal":"Regional anesthesia and pain medicine","title":"Navigating current controversies in radiofrequency ablation of the genicular nerves for chronic knee pain in osteoarthritis: a daring discourse.","authors":"Ferreira-Silva N; Ferreira-Dos-Santos G; Cunat T; Ribeiro-da-Silva T; Peng P","abstract":"Chronic knee joint pain affects millions worldwide, with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of genicular nerves emerging as a potential treatment in the last 15 years.

While various workplace safety risks for anesthesiologists have been documented, head injuries remain an underrecognized hazard. This study aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of head strikes among anesthesiologists and perioperative nurses, examine reporting practices, and identify potential preventive strategies. METHODS: In this mixed-methods, cross-sectional national study, a 22-question survey was distributed to U.S.-based anesthesiologists and perioperative nurses in February and March of 2024. The survey, developed by a multidisciplinary team, included multiple-choice and free-response questions. The primary outcome measure was whether the individual had experienced a head strike in an operating or procedural room in the prior 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included the number of head strikes; source, timing, and head location of the strike; the amount of time taken off from work; whether a safety report was filed; and free-text responses for contributing factors, suggested changes to reduce risk, and challenges in reporting injuries. Qualitative responses were coded by investigator pairs using two collectively developed codebooks with themes and subthemes emerging inductively. RESULTS: Of the 1,549 anesthesiologists (6.6% response rate) and 287 nurses (2.7% response rate), 1,441 (78.5%) reported at least one head strike in the preceding year. Common sources included monitors (73.4% of respondents), light heads (37.4%), and boom-mounted equipment (33.4%). Most (948, 65.8%) incidents occurred intraoperatively. Causes of head strikes were multifactorial, frequently a combination of equipment placement, clinician movement, and tasks occurring under time pressure. Only 69 (4.8%) filed a safety report following a head strike. Barriers to reporting included time constraints, perception of strikes as minor incidents, and fear of negative consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Head strikes are a common but underreported occupational hazard in perioperative and periprocedural settings. Multi-faceted interventions addressing equipment design, workspace organization, and reporting culture are needed to reduce such risks.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40663557\/"},{"pmid":40663518,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Intraoperative Ketamine for Acute Postsurgical Pain after Breast Cancer Surgery: The Moderating Effect of Baseline Temporal Summation of Pain.","authors":"Wilson JM; Gokul S; Franqueiro AR; Rosado E; Yong RJ; Edwards RR; Schreiber KL","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Activation of nociceptive pathways by surgical trauma can induce central sensitization, which is associated with greater pain severity and persistence. The NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine blocks central sensitization, but has a variable track-record for preventing postsurgical pain. Patient-level factors contribute to variability in pain and may serve as markers of differential efficacy of preventive effect. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal randomized controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of intraoperatively administered ketamine to decrease postoperative pain after breast surgery. Before surgery, patients reported demographic and medical information and completed validated pain and psychosocial questionnaires. A subset of patients also underwent quantitative sensory testing to assess baseline temporal summation of pain (central sensitization tendency). Analyses of Covariance, controlling for relevant pre- and peri-operative factors, examined treatment group (ketamine vs. saline) differences in 2-week postoperative pain outcomes. Exploratory moderation analysis explored whether the efficacy of ketamine differed based on patients' baseline temporal summation of pain. RESULTS: Of the sample of 225 patients, 113 received ketamine and 112 received placebo. The majority of patients underwent lumpectomy (53%), with 16% undergoing mastectomy and 30% mastectomy with reconstruction. There were no significant treatment group differences in pain severity or impact reported two weeks after surgery. However, moderation analysis revealed that among patients with higher baseline temporal summation of pain, ketamine was associated with lower pain severity and impact scores. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine was not associated with an analgesic benefit over placebo in the acute postoperative period, as measured using a variety of pain assessments. However, exploratory moderation analysis suggested that patients with evidence of a greater central sensitization at baseline may derive an analgesic effect of ketamine. These findings support future collection of baseline phenotypic patient characteristics related to relevant mechanisms in trials, to identify which patients may derive a larger benefit from analgesic interventions.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40663518\/"},{"pmid":40654033,"journal":"European journal of anaesthesiology","title":"Post discharge digital health technology interventions in ambulatory surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","authors":"Bentsen SB; Stjernberg M; Raeder J; Eide GE; Tvedt MN; Hegland PA","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Given the early discharge associated with ambulatory surgery, digital health interventions (DHIs) may be useful in out of hospital follow-up.

METHODS: Patients aged >\/= 65 y scheduled to undergo gastrectomy were randomly allocated to maintenance of general anaesthesia with a remimazolam infusion (remimazolam group) or propofol target-controlled infusion (propofol group) in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of delirium within 72 h of surgery (assessed using the confusion assessment method). Secondary outcomes included the quality of recovery at 24 h postoperatively (assessed using the translated Korean version of the 15-item Quality of Recovery questionnaire) and the incidence of postoperative nausea, retching and vomiting. RESULTS: Of 461 patients randomly allocated in the study, 432 were included in the analysis (216 in each group). The incidence of delirium was 17\/216 (7.9%) in patients allocated to the remimazolam group and 17\/216 (7.9%) in those allocated to the propofol group (unadjusted odds ratio 1.00, 95%CI 0.50-2.02, p = 1.000). Quality of recovery scores were also similar between groups at 24 h postoperatively (median (IQR [range]) 109 (102-115 [54-140]) vs. 109 (104-115 [70-137]) for the remimazolam and propofol groups, respectively (p = 0.627); unadjusted odds ratio -0.03, 95%CI -0.19-0.13).

Although temporary PNS is widely incorporated, either as a screening trial or a treatment itself, the evidence supporting the use of temporary PNS prior to permanent implantation is limited. We aimed to compare pain relief, opioid consumption, and adverse events between an approach implementing temporary PNS before permanent implantation (temporary-to-permanent (TTP)) vs proceeding directly to permanent PNS implantation (direct-to-permanent (DTP)). METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was undertaken at seven major academic institutions from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2024. Adult patients who underwent permanent PNS implantation for the treatment of chronic pain conditions were included and were divided into TTP or DTP cohorts based on their clinical approach. The dual primary outcomes were pain relief and opioid consumption (in oral morphine equivalents) at 6 months compared with baseline before any PNS therapy. Multivariable Tobit regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of pain relief at 6 months using a stepwise approach. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were analyzed (54 in TTP approach, 76 in DTP approach). Patient-reported percentage pain relief was 56.7%+\/-27.9% at 6 months compared with baseline (before PNS implantation) in the TTP cohort, and 45.1%+\/-33.6% in the DTP cohort. The estimated mean percentage pain relief at 6 months was similar in the TTP and DTP cohorts (between-group difference 15.24%; 95% CI -0.32 to 30.80, p=0.052), with consistent findings after sensitivity analysis with multiple imputation. Opioid consumption declined similarly in the TTP (-3.1+\/-9.9 mg) and DTP (-2.1+\/-8.1 mg) cohorts at 6 months with no statistical difference between cohorts (mean between-group difference: -1.00, 95% CI -4.57 to 2.57, p=0.580), and with consistent findings after sensitivity analysis. Device explantation rates and adverse event profiles were comparable between cohorts. CONCLUSION: Although temporary PNS is widely performed prior to permanent PNS implantation, there was no evidence that the TTP approach is associated with superior analgesic outcomes compared with the DTP approach. Further, patients in both approaches achieved clinically meaningful pain relief at 6 months compared with baseline status prior to PNS therapy.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40659443\/"},{"pmid":40668003,"journal":"Pain","title":"Androgen levels and experimental pain sensitivity in healthy young adolescent girls.","authors":"Banerjee G; Brown J; McMichael A; Ben Abdallah A; Buday S; Baranski TJ; Haroutounian S; Barch D; AuBuchon J; Nahman-Averbuch H","abstract":"Androgens, such as testosterone, have an antinociceptive effect based on animal and adult studies. However, because androgens may exert different physiological effects during puberty, it is not clear whether the antinociceptive effect would also be found in adolescents. Thus, this study examined the relationships between testosterone levels and experimental pain sensitivity in healthy young adolescent girls. In addition, the relationships between experimental pain sensitivity and other androgens, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione, were explored, and the role of puberty in moderating these relationships was tested. Forty-five healthy girls (11.91 +\/- 1.35 years) completed comprehensive psychophysical assessments of heat, cold, and pressure pain thresholds, heat and cold pain intensity ratings, temporal summation, heat- and pressure-conditioned pain modulation, offset analgesia, and cold pain tolerance. Blood samples were collected to analyze sex hormone levels. Participants also completed the Pubertal Developmental Scale. Correlations and regression models examined the associations between androgens and experimental pain sensitivity, and whether pubertal stage moderated these relationships. Overall, no significant associations were found between levels of testosterone, DHEA, DHEA-S, dihydrotestosterone, or androstenedione and experimental pain sensitivity, nor were these associations moderated by pubertal stage. Only DHEA-S levels were related to cold pain threshold and tolerance, and pubertal stage moderated the relationship between DHEA-S and cold pain tolerance, which was significant only in the late (r = 0.453, P = 0.027) but not early-mid puberty group. The results of this study suggest that androgens may have a minimal effect on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy young adolescent girls.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40668003\/"},{"pmid":40667996,"journal":"Pain","title":"Peripheral contributions to offset analgesia: effects of stimulus duration, intensity, and location.","authors":"Sun P; Wong APH; Asplund CL; Derbyshire SWG","abstract":"Offset analgesia (OA) is a substantial decrease in pain perception after a minor reduction in noxious stimulus intensity. The peripheral mechano- and heat-sensitive A-fibre nociceptors (AMH-I and AMH-II) and the C-fibre nociceptors (CMH) are hypothesised to contribute to OA. These nociceptors differ in initial response latency, peak response latency, and heat threshold, and the AMH-II fibres may be absent from the palm. Stimuli targeting those different nociceptive properties were used to decide which nociceptors critically contribute to OA. Healthy volunteers (N = 64) underwent 16 unique trials with continuous noxious heat (45-47 degrees C). These trials included 3-second (short) or 12-second (long) periods of increased noxious heat (46-48 degrees C), or an intense 0.2 seconds pulse of heat (51 degrees C). Stimuli were delivered to the dorsum (back) and palm of the hands. Notable OA effects were observed for long-duration trials on both the dorsum and palm of the hand. Offset analgesia was inconsistently present and much smaller for the short-duration trials and for the pulse trials. Pain ratings generally increased more slowly during palm stimulation compared with dorsum stimulation. The demonstration of OA on the palm suggests that AMH-II nociceptors are either not critical for OA or that the AMH-II nociceptors are present in the palm. The small OA after the intense pulse and the substantial reduction in OA during the short trials suggests that AMH-I nociceptors are not necessary for OA and that the faster response of the AMH-II or CMH nociceptors is not sufficient to generate OA.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40667996\/"},{"pmid":40667986,"journal":"Pain","title":"Decreased KCC2 expression in the human spinal dorsal horn associated with chronic pain and long-term opioid use.","authors":"Davis OC; Ferland S; Lorenzo LE; Murray-Lawson C; Shiers S; Yousuf MS; Dedek A; Tsai EC; Vines E; Horton P; Cervantes A; Khan T; Funk G; Dussor G; Godin AG; Ferrini F; De Koninck Y; Hildebrand ME; Price TJ","abstract":"Loss of GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory efficacy in the spinal dorsal horn is associated with neuropathic pain and opioid-induced hyperalgesia in rodent models.

While lidocaine (local anesthetic) and dexamethasone (anti-inflammatory) are used individually to prevent POST, their combined efficacy remains unclear. This meta-analysis synthesizes evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine whether Intravenous dexamethasone-lidocaine combination is more effective than dexamethasone alone in reducing POST incidence. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify studies comparing the effect of dexamethasone with and without lidocaine on the incidence of POST, cough, and hoarseness. Statistical analysis was performed on RevMan. Data were pooled using a random-effects model (Mantel-Haenszel method), with results reported as risk ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs); heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We use Gradpro GDT and Trial sequential analysis to assess the certainty and reliability of evidence, respectively. RESULTS: Our search retrieved 116 articles, of which 31 were duplicates. At the end of the selection process based on prespecified eligibility criteria, three randomized controlled trials were included in the final meta-analysis. Dexamethasone-lidocaine significantly reduces the incidence of POST compared to dexamethasone alone, with a (RR: 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.37-0.75; P = 0.0003, I(2) = 0 %). The meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference in postoperative cough (RR: 0.81; 95 % CI: 0.41-1.61; P = 0.55, I(2) = 24 %) and hoarseness (RR: 0.60; 95 % CI: 0.29-1.22; P = 0.16, I(2) = 24 %) between the dexamethasone-lidocaine combination and dexamethasone alone. Non-significance doesn't prove groups are comparable; wide confidence intervals suggest a potentially meaningful difference in cough incidence. GRADE assessment analysis showed high evidence for POST and cough but showed moderate evidence for hoarseness and cough. Trial sequential analysis showed insufficient evidence to conclude that Dexamethasone-lidocaine reduces the incidence of POST. CONCLUSION: The dexamethasone-lidocaine combination suggests a clinically meaningful reduction in POST compared to dexamethasone alone, with consistent effects across studies. While not impacting hoarseness and cough, these robust findings support adopting this readily available, cost-effective strategy to enhance recovery after intubation. The combination's benefit on the most common postoperative complications justifies its inclusion in airway management protocols. Further trials are needed to support and enhance the reliability of this current evidence.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40651058\/"},{"pmid":40644393,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"Recovery of the acute hypoxic ventilatory response after reversal of a minimal neuromuscular block.

We examined the effect of sugammadex 2 mg\/kg and 4 mg\/kg compared to spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular block (NMB) on the recovery of the acute hypoxic ventilatory response (AHVR). METHODS: This was a 2-experiment, randomized, controlled trial in healthy volunteers. Participants received a continuous infusion of rocuronium, to achieve stable symptoms of neuromuscular block in the head and neck region (symptomatic NMB). Thereafter, NMB was allowed to recover spontaneously in the first experiment, while in experiment 2, volunteers were randomized to receive sugammadex 2 mg\/kg or 4 mg\/kg for reversal. The depth of neuromuscular block was assessed with electromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle. AHVR was measured at baseline; during stable NMB; and at 0-, 20-, and 40-minutes post-recovery. RESULTS: Thirty-seven volunteers were enrolled; data from 27 volunteers were eligible for analysis. AHVR was reduced by 32% (mean difference versus baseline (MD) -0.22 L.%-1.min-1, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.12) during symptomatic NMB (mean train of four ratio 0.42 +\/- 0.22;). At the disappearance of all symptoms, AHVR remained on average depressed by 23% (MD -0.16 L.%-1.min-1, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.04). In 57% of volunteers following spontaneous recovery versus 28% following sugammadex reversal, AHVR did not return to baseline values during the measurement period.

However, on average AHVR was not significantly different from baseline at 20 and 40 minutes post-recovery in any group. CONCLUSIONS: The AHVR after reversal of a minimal NMB with sugammadex did not significantly differ with spontaneous recovery of NMB. However, fewer patients had residual depression of AHVR when sugammadex was used.

However, increased blood pressure also raises pulsatile force. Cerebrovascular compliance plays a key role in buffering flow dynamics and protecting the microcirculation, but whether it adapts to elevated pressure remains unclear. This study assessed the response of compliant cerebral arteries to induced hypertension in healthy adults using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PCMRI) and two compliance models: a two-element Windkessel (CWK) and a simplified model (CVP), representing the extremes of pulsatility transmission at the capillary level. METHODS: Eighteen healthy adults (median age: 34 years; 9 females) underwent PCMRI at baseline and after increasing mean arterial pressure by 20% using norepinephrine (NE) infusion. PCMRI quantified CBF and cardiac output, while cerebrovascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance were derived. Flow waveforms were combined with blood pressure to assess CWK and CVP in CBF, ascending\/descending aorta, and external carotid arteries, while corresponding regions of interest were used to calculate cross-sectional flow areas. Data are reported as median (interquartile range). RESULTS: NE increased cerebrovascular compliance significantly; CWK by 110% (56% to 163%; P=0.001) and CVP by 11% (-2% to 26%; P=0.018). CWK increased in the external carotid artery by 12% (1% to 32%; P=0.037) but did not change in the ascending or descending aorta.

However, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are ineffective in mitigating nociplastic pain, and current prescription treatments, such as opioids, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants, provide limited therapeutic benefit for these indications. In the current work, we extended previous studies in rats of central Toll-like receptor 4-dependent pain hypersensitivity to male and female C57BL\/6N mice, uncovering an unexpected hyperalgesic phenotype in female mice following intrathecal (IT) lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In contrast to previous reports in female C57BL\/6J mice, female C57BL\/6N mice displayed tactile and cold allodynia, grip force deficits, and a modest increase in locomotor activity in response to IT LPS. Congruent with our previous observations in male rats, LPS released spinal 12\/15-lipoxygenase (12\/15-LOX) metabolites (12\/15-LMs) in female C57BL\/6N mice. Likewise, 12\/15-LOX enzymes are basally expressed in multiple tissues and cell types relevant to nociceptive transmission. Systemic inhibition of 12\/15-LOX in female C57BL\/6N mice with selective inhibitors ML355 (targeting 12-LOX-p) or ML351 (targeting 15-LOX-1) completely reversed allodynia and grip force deficits. 12\/15-LMs also produce tactile allodynia when administered spinally (IT) or peripherally (paw intraplantar) at a subthreshold dose in a hyperalgesic priming model, similar to others' observations with a subthreshold dose of the cyclooxygenase metabolite prostaglandin E2. Collectively, these data suggest that 12\/15-LOX enzymes contribute to peripheral and central pain hypersensitivity in rodents, with potential translatability as druggable targets across sexes and species using multiple reflexive and functional outcome measures.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40667997\/"},{"pmid":40645808,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Coding of post-surgical pain in ICD-11: between conceptual richness and practical constraints.","authors":"Martinez V; Spagna A; Attal N","abstract":"The 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) marks a decisive step forward in recognising chronic postsurgical pain as a distinct clinical entity.

Patients with ITM reported lower pain scores and greater satisfaction at 24 hours (median (Q1-Q3), ITM 108 (102.25-113.5) vs anterior subcostal QL block 75.5 (58-100)) and discharge (ITM 117 (115-123.75) vs anterior subcostal QL block 94 (77-110); p<0.001). However, no between-group differences were observed in 30-day complication rates, including the Clavien-Dindo and Comprehensive Complication Index scores. Adverse effects, such as nausea, pruritus, and respiratory events, were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Although designed as a non-inferiority trial, anterior subcostal QL block did not meet the threshold. While ITM resulted in lower opioid use, the study was not powered to establish superiority. Anterior subcostal QL block may be considered for patients at risk of ITM-related respiratory depression; however, its inconsistent cranial spread and limited visceral analgesia may explain its lower efficacy. Caution is also required in anticoagulated patients because of the deep anatomical location of the block.

Data from training programs raised concerns that Milestones ratings may reflect the year of training more than resident progress toward competency. We examined the relationship between residents' Milestones ratings toward the end of residency training and their performance on the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) examinations, widely considered as the gold standard of competency. METHODS: We compared Milestones 2.0 ratings and board scores of all anesthesiologists who completed an ACGME-accredited residency program between July 2021 and June 2022 (AY22) and had their first-time ABA ADVANCED Examination (written), Standardized Oral Examination (SOE) and Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) performance available by 2023. We first assessed the correlation between the average rating achieved across all 23 Milestones during the last 6 months of residency training and the Z-scores of these three examinations among first-time takers. Then, we evaluated the correlations between 9 specific Milestones and their conceptually related domains tested by the ADVANCED, the SOE, and the OSCE; we calculated Pearson and polychoric correlation coefficients for continuous and ordinal data, respectively. RESULTS: All 23 Milestones 2.0 AY22 ratings were available for 1849 Post Graduate Year (PGY)-4, Clinical Anesthesia Year 3 (CA-3) residents. These were matched to 1799 first-time ADVANCED and 1383 first-time SOE and OSCE takers. The average ACGME Milestones ratings across all competencies were significantly correlated with examination Z-scores (all P < .001)-the ADVANCED (r = 0.135 [95% confidence interval CI, 0.089-0.180], the SOE (r = 0.117 [0.065-0.169]), and the OSCE (r = 0.112 [0.060-0.164]). For the domain-specific comparisons, scores on the ADVANCED Examination correlated modestly with the Medical Knowledge Milestone domain (r = 0.289, P < .001), but there were no statistically significant associations between SOE task ratings and their related Milestones domains (rho = 0.027 to 0.091, P = .31 to 0.81). In comparisons of similar domains evaluated by OSCE stations and the Milestones, 2 were statistically significantly correlated with a weak magnitude (Interpretation of Monitors and Echocardiograms [rho = 0.093, P = .031] and Ethical Issues [rho = 0.049, P = .003]) while 2 others were not statistically significant (Application of Ultrasonography [rho = 0.052, P = .775] and Communication with other Professionals [rho = 0.052, P = .086]). CONCLUSIONS: There was a modest correlation between the last Medical Knowledge Milestone achieved and the ADVANCED Examination. However, the weak correlations between residency Milestones and the SOE or OSCE performance suggest that the Milestones system, as currently implemented by anesthesiology training programs, does not predict certifying examination performance.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40638528\/"},{"pmid":40638527,"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","title":"Age-Dependent Entropic Features During Propofol Anesthesia in Developing Brain.","authors":"Zhang Y; Liang ZH; Wang X; Zhang N; Zhu HT; Wang DX; Guo XY; Li XL; Song LL","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Precise monitoring of anesthetic depth in children receiving propofol anesthesia is crucial. Commercial depth of anesthesia monitoring devices do not account for age-related changes in brain states and provide misleading information regarding the actual depth in young children. Entropy analysis, a typical complexity methodology, has been demonstrated to be a simple and robust tool for monitoring consciousness levels during anesthesia in adults. The validity of entropic measures for depth of anesthesia monitoring in children receiving general anesthesia remains largely unexplored. The age-related entropic feature dynamics during propofol anesthesia are still not clear. METHODS: We prospectively studied frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from subjects aged 1 to 18 years receiving propofol anesthesia. We calculated spectral power, permutation entropy (PeEn), sample entropy (SampEn), beta ratio, and bispectral index (BIS) from EEG segments obtained during wakefulness, maintenance, and recovery. PeEn quantifies the randomness of a time series and SampEn quantifies its unpredictability. Both measures convey complexity information on local connectivity within neural circuits for an EEG signal. The accuracy of these EEG measures to distinguish between propofol-induced unresponsiveness and clinical recovery was assessed. The changes in entropic feature dynamics with age during propofol anesthesia were investigated. RESULTS: Seventy-seven subjects were included for analysis. Propofol induced a significant decrease in frontal PeEn (from a median [interquartile range] of 0.75 [0.71-0.78] during wakefulness to 0.61 [0.57-0.63] during maintenance, P < .001), which returned to wakefulness levels during recovery (0.75 [0.71-0.79]), contrasting with BIS, which remained lower. A significant increase in SampEn was noted from wakefulness to maintenance (0.04 [0.04-0.06] vs 0.25 [0.20-0.28], P < .001). PeEn provided excellent performance for distinguishing between unresponsiveness and clinical recovery at an optimal classification threshold of 0.67 with the accuracy of 96.6%. The distinguishing capability of PeEn appeared superior in toddlers compared to BIS (accuracy: 94.7% vs 88.9%). SampEn also exhibited good distinguishing accuracy of 81.1% at an optimal threshold of 0.18. Frontal PeEn and SampEn, indicating information amount of intracortical neural circuits connectivity, decreased with age during propofol maintenance (P = .017 and .026, respectively). The adolescents exhibited significantly lower frontal power, PeEn, and SampEn values during propofol administration. CONCLUSIONS: The frontal PeEn served as an excellent indicator for distinguishing propofol-induced unresponsiveness from recovery in children. Frontal complexity, represented by PeEn and SampEn, decreased with age during propofol maintenance, which was hypothesized to reflect sequential neurophysiological development in frontal cortex, particularly its maturation during adolescence.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40638527\/"},{"pmid":40637299,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"Potential Benefits of Medical Nutrition Therapy for Timely Ventilator Weaning in the Critically Ill.","authors":"De Rosa S; Rauseo M; Umbrello M; Lassola S; Battaglini D","abstract":"Nutritional support and metabolic assessment are crucial in weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation. This review explores strategies for metabolic assessment and tailored nutritional interventions and their impact on weaning outcomes, highlighting individualized nutritional interventions. While indirect calorimetry provides direct metabolic data, diaphragm ultrasound can complement metabolic monitoring by assessing respiratory muscle function and detecting early signs of muscle wasting. Protein intake in critically ill patients remains controversial, as early high protein administration (greater than 1.2 g\/kg each day) has not demonstrated clear benefits and may even be detrimental to successful ventilator weaning, supporting the adoption of a moderate, individualized nutritional strategy. Vitamin D deficiency is common in critically ill patients, and targeted supplementation may reduce mechanical ventilation duration. High-fat and ketogenic diets have shown limited benefit and are not currently recommended. Some nutritional supplements (e.g., creatine, branched-chain amino acids, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate) are under investigation, but current evidence does not support their routine use. A personalized approach integrating metabolic assessment, tailored protein intake, and vitamin D optimization may improve weaning success, functional recovery, and post-intensive care unit outcomes.

Unfortunately, the exact mechanism by which changes in mitochondrial target activity result in clinically relevant anesthetic endpoints remains unknown. Here, the authors leveraged knowledge of propofol toxicity to guide drug discovery and uncover a previously unknown pharmacologic target within mitochondria. They hypothesized that, like propofol, quinone analogs would interfere with electron transfer, cause excessive proton leak within mitochondria, and induce hypnosis. The authors tested their hypothesis using the short-chain coenzyme Q analog ubiquinone-5 (Ub5) and aimed to characterize its anesthetic phenotype in the mouse and elucidate the source of Ub5-induced mitochondrial leak. METHODS: Anesthetic phenotype was assessed in vivo in the mouse using behavioral and neurophysiological approaches. The authors measured biologic activity in isolated mitochondria using polarography and spectrophotometry and identified source of proton leak using pharmacologic inhibitors, mutant mouse strains, and transport activity assays in proteoliposomes. Finally, they assessed cardiotoxic effects in the isolated-perfused mouse heart ex vivo . RESULTS: Coenzyme Q analogs caused uncompensated proton leak in developing cardiomyocyte mitochondria and reversible cardiotoxicity in a manner reminiscent of propofol. Tail vein injection of Ub5 induced short-lived loss of righting, electroencephalogram changes consistent with a deep state of anesthesia, and reversible decreases in neuronal calcium transients and mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo . Precipitous decline in mitochondrial membrane potential played a role in Ub5-induced unconsciousness, and the authors identified the aspartate-glutamate carrier Aralar as a functional target and source of Ub5-mediated proton leak. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that uncompensated mitochondrial proton leak is an important mechanistic contributor to the anesthetic response in addition to electron transport inhibition. These findings advance the authors' understanding of how anesthetics induce hypnosis and lay the foundation for next-generation drug discovery.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40315373\/"},{"pmid":40640047,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Impact of superficial and deep parasternal blocks on recovery after cardiac surgery with sternotomy: a randomised controlled trial.","authors":"Demarquette A; Jeanneteau A; Blanchard-Daguet A; Fouquet O; Parot-Schinkel E; Lasocki S; Rineau E; Leger M","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pain is common after cardiac surgery and can impair recovery. Regional anaesthesia has been proposed to limit pain, but its impact on recovery is unknown. This study compared the impact of superficial or deep parasternal intercostal plane blocks (SPIP or DPIP) in addition to standard care vs standard care alone on postoperative quality of recovery (QoR) after cardiac surgery with sternotomy. METHODS: In this single-centre, randomised, single-blind, controlled trial, adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with sternotomy were randomly assigned to one of three groups (with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio): control group (standard care without regional anaesthesia), SPIP group, or DPIP group. The primary endpoint was QoR assessed using a French validated version of the Quality of Recovery-15 questionnaire at 24 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores, analgesic consumption, ICU and hospital length of stay, and adverse events. RESULTS: Between July 1, 2022, and August 30, 2023, we randomised 254 patients (81.1% men, 65.5 [27-85] yr). The French validated version of the Quality of Recovery-15 scores did not significantly differ between any parasternal block group (SPIP or DPIP) and the standard care group (P=0.248).

This study examined the pharmacokinetics of levobupivacaine with and without epinephrine during thoracic erector spinae plane (ESP) or transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks, simulating reported 48-h dosing regimens to evaluate safety. METHODS: Data from three studies were analysed. Study 1 included 38 patients receiving an ESP block before video-assisted thoracoscopy, whereas Study 2 analysed published data on TAP blocks. Both studies used 20 ml of levobupivacaine 0.25% with or without epinephrine (5 mug ml(-1)), measuring arterial concentrations over 90 min. Study 3 involved intravenous bupivacaine administration in 10 healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic analysis used NONMEM software, with significance set at P<0.05. RESULTS: We analysed 258 ESP samples, 150 TAP samples, and 190 bupivacaine i.v. SAMPLES: A one-compartment model described the data, with a mean distribution volume of 41.9 L (coefficient of variation, 47%) and clearance rate of 0.288 L min(-1) (coefficient of variation, 38%). Epinephrine reduced bioavailability (54.3% vs 32.8%) and prolonged absorption half-life (0.84 min vs 1.55 min; P<0.05). Simulated doses of 50 mg plus 300 mg per 24 h over 48 h remained below toxic thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Similar dosing regimens for ESP and TAP blocks are supported by this pharmacokinetic analysis, with epinephrine effectively reducing systemic drug concentrations by prolonging absorption half-life and lowering bioavailability. The findings suggest that extended 300 mg per 24 h dosing for 48 h is likely to be safe. Further studies in broader patient populations are warranted to evaluate safety.

Therefore, a good understanding of this syndrome is important. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge of bone cement implantation syndrome. METHODS: This scoping review was conducted based on the PRISMA-ScR Checklist. A literature search was done in PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase. A total of 85 studies were included in the study. RESULTS: The incidence of bone cement implantation syndrome during cemented hip or knee arthroplasty varied from 15.4% to 46.7% and 27.5% to 70.7%, respectively.

Lateral hypothalamic area orexinergic neurones (LHA(OX)), projecting broadly, are essential in regulating arousal and pain. However, the precise targets remain unclear. Here we investigated the orexin projections to the substantia innominata (SI). METHODS: Combining optogenetics, fibre photometry, electroencephalography, and electromyography allowed us to manipulate orexin activities while simultaneously recording local ligand release and global cortical activities during isoflurane anaesthesia. Brain slice electrophysiology revealed the synaptic connections in SI, while RNAscope was used to examine the distribution of orexin receptors and downstream neuronal types. RESULTS: Presynaptic vesicles were identified in the orexin-releasing axon terminals in SI, where 49.2% of cells expressed orexin receptor-2 (OX2R) and 6.8% expressed orexin receptor-1 (OX1R). Orexin release in SI was reversibly suppressed by isoflurane. Optogenetic activation of the LHA(OX)-->SI circuit increased orexin release and promoted arousal from various anaesthesia stages, including during isoflurane 0.75 vol% (P<0.0001), prolongation of isoflurane 3 vol% induction (P=0.0033), and acceleration of emergence from isoflurane 2 vol% (P<0.0001). Furthermore, activating this circuit induced analgesia to both thermal (P<0.0001) and inflammatory (P<0.0001) pain. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that optogenetic activation of orexin terminals in SI elicited excitatory postsynaptic currents, which were blocked by an OX2R antagonist. The SI contains more GABAergic (28.2%) and glutamatergic (12.0%) neurones than cholinergic neurones (4.1%), all of which expressed OX2R.

OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on restoration of diaphragmatic function and postoperative atelectasis in paediatric patients. DESIGN: A prospective randomised controlled study. SETTING: Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. PATIENTS: A total of 73 children aged 2 to 7 years were randomised to receive either sugammadex (2 mg kg-1, n = 36) or neostigmine (0.02 mg kg-1, n = 37) for neuromuscular blockade reversal when the train-of-four count reached 4 (train-of-four ratio < 0.9). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The diaphragmatic excursion (DE) and thickening fraction (TF) were measured by ultrasound at three timepoints: baseline (T0), before postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) admission (T1) and 30 min after PACU admission (T2). Atelectasis was assessed via lung ultrasonography at T1 and T2. The primary outcome was the diaphragmatic excursion ratio at T1 (DET1\/DET0), and secondary outcomes included the DET2\/DET0, TFT1\/TFT0, TFT2\/TFT0 atelectasis score and incidence of significant atelectasis. RESULTS: At T1, the DET1\/DET0 was significantly higher in the sugammadex group (neostigmine vs. sugammadex group, 0.91 +\/- 0.19 vs. 1.02 +\/- 0.24; P = 0.034) as was the TFT1\/TFT0 (0.93 +\/- 0.39 vs. 1.15 +\/- 0.49; P = 0.041).

This study hypothesized that sevoflurane can induce persistent upregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammation, and behavioral deficits in young adult male rats by stimulating hypothalamic arginine vasopressin (AVP) production via Na + -K + -Cl - (NKCC1) Cl - importer\/gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor signaling. These changes may also result in neurocognitive deficits in the offspring of exposed rats ( i.e. , intergenerational PND). METHODS: Sprague Dawley male rats (generation F0) were exposed to 2.1% sevoflurane for 3 h on postnatal days 56, 58, and 60. Before each sevoflurane exposure. they received vehicle (F0M_S group), the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (F0M_BS group), or the glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor RU486 (F0M_RS group). They were mated on postnatal day 90 with treatment-naive females to generate offspring (generation F1). RESULTS: Consistent with our hypothesis, short-term and sustained changes in F0M_S rats, but not F0M_BS and F0M_RS rats, included increased hypothalamic c-FOS and AVP (but not oxytocin) expression, increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, increased levels of systemic and central inflammatory markers, and increased Nkcc1 \/ K + -2Cl - ( Kcc2 ) Cl - exporter mRNA ratios in the brain. F0M_S males, but not F0M_BS and F0M_RS males, exhibited anxiety-like behavior and deficits in sensorimotor gating and spatial memory. Male offspring of F0M_S sires, but not F0M_BS or F0M_RS sires, exhibited behavioral abnormalities similar to those in F0M_S, as well as alterations in social behavior. The only deficit in F1 females was impaired spatial memory in the offspring of F0M_S. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a role for hypothalamic NKCC1\/gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor\/AVP signaling in sevoflurane-triggered PND in adult male rats, which also affects their future sevoflurane-unexposed offspring. NKCC1 and glucocorticoid receptors could serve as therapeutic targets for prevention of sevoflurane-induced PND in exposed rats and in their future offspring.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40408187\/"},{"pmid":40628584,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Training and assessment of skills in neuraxial space access: a scoping review of educational approaches to lumbar puncture, epidural anaesthesia, and spinal anaesthesia.","authors":"Nielsen MS; Ilkjaer FV; Grejs AM; Nielsen AB; Konge L; Brochner AC","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Neuraxial space access, including lumbar puncture, spinal anaesthesia, and epidural anaesthesia, is important in clinical practise for diagnostics and anaesthesia. Despite frequent use, standardised educational recommendations for training and assessing proficiency in these procedures are not well-integrated. The following research question was formulated: what is known from published literature to guide future educational recommendations for training and skills assessment of neuraxial space access with and without the use of ultrasound? METHODS: On May 7, 2024, searches were performed in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), and EMBASE (Ovid). Studies were eligible if they involved physicians, medical students, or nurses and focused on training or assessment of neuraxial space access skills. No comparator was required, and all study designs were included if outcomes could be assessed using Kirkpatrick framework. There were no restrictions on language or publication date. Methodological quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). RESULTS: The review included 99 studies, and overall, 28 (28%) of the included studies were of low quality with a MERSQI score <9, whereas 22 (22%) were of high quality with a MERSQI score of >\/=14. The designs were primarily cohort studies (68%) and RCTs (24%). Specialities represented were mainly anaesthesia (22%) and paediatrics (17%), but many were not reported (30%). Training modalities varied, predominantly using low-fidelity manikins (55%). Simulation-based methods enhanced procedural confidence and technical skills. CONCLUSIONS: Studies on education in neuraxial space access show substantial variation in educational approaches and assessment. Consistent findings indicate that simulation-based training enhances outcomes across multiple Kirkpatrick levels, although the studies generally have low methodological quality. Further high-quality research is needed, especially linking training and assessment to patient outcomes.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40628584\/"},{"pmid":40628582,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Effects of ketamine on postoperative cognition: a scoping review.","authors":"Brenna CTA; He XW; Liu D; Kaustov L; Choi S; Orser BA","abstract":"Postoperative delirium and other forms of perioperative neurocognitive deficits occur commonly in older adult patients. Ketamine, administered either before or during general anaesthesia, may have cognitive-sparing properties owing to its ability to reduce neuroinflammation, increase neurotrophin levels, or allow reductions in the doses of other general anaesthetic drugs. However, the efficacy of ketamine in preventing perioperative neurocognitive disorders remains highly controversial. This scoping review summarises clinical studies that examined the cognitive-sparing properties of ketamine in adult surgical patients. Clinical trials and retrospective cohort analyses that assessed cognition in adult patients after treatment with racemic (R,S) ketamine, esketamine, or arketamine were identified through a systematic search of the Embase and Embase Classic databases (from 1947 to 2025). Overall, we identified 58 studies involving 6830 patients. Most studies (n=31) evaluated postoperative delirium and, of these, most used a derivative of the Confusion Assessment Method as the primary measurement tool (81%). Thirty-nine studies evaluated other types of perioperative neurocognitive disorders; of these, 24 (62%) used the Mini Mental State Examination and six (15%) used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Ketamine produced no cognitive benefits in 35 of the 58 studies (60%), whereas 23 studies (40%) reported a reduced incidence or duration of perioperative neurocognitive disorders, or both. There were no clear trends in terms of the doses, enantiomeric formulations, or timing of ketamine administration associated with favourable cognitive outcomes. However, ketamine studies that evaluated cognition at only early postoperative timepoints were more likely to report no cognitive benefit. Most trials were underpowered to detect changes in cognitive endpoints, and study populations and methods were too heterogeneous to support meaningful meta-analyses. Although the current results summarised in this extensive review are inconsistent, the data nevertheless support the need for larger, well-designed trials to determine whether subgroups of patients that undergo specific types of surgeries might benefit from ketamine. Recommendations regarding the direction of future research are proposed.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40628582\/"},{"pmid":40627996,"journal":"Journal of clinical anesthesia","title":"Association between race, ethnicity, and surgical case cancellations: A retrospective study in a cohort of patients undergoing oncological surgeries.","authors":"Cata JP; Owusu-Agyemang P; Adesoye T; Feng L","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Surgical delays and cancellations have been shown to occur more frequently in racial and ethnic minority patients. We hypothesized that race and ethnicity are independent risk factors for surgical cancellations in patients with cancer. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed surgical procedures in a large tertiary cancer center. The primary outcome was surgical cancellation before or on the intended surgery date. The primary exposure variable was a patient's self-reported race and ethnicity. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to estimate the effects of covariates on the status of case cancellation. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 109,400 surgical cases, the overall rate of cancellation was 4.45 %. The highest rate was among patients in the head and neck service (15.04 %). Overall, changes in treatment were a frequent cause of cancellations (54.9 %). Black patients had the highest rate of cancellations among all ethnicities (5.4 %), with the breast surgical oncology service having the highest rate of cancellations among Black patients (16.6 %). After only including unique first clinical encounters of each patient (N = 78,227) and with adjustment of gender, age-adjusted CCI and primary surgery type in a mixed effects model which treated surgery date as a cluster variable, patients identified as NH-Asian (OR, 99.8 % CI: 0.56, 0.40-0.79), and NH-White (OR, 99.8 % CI: 0.64, 0.53-0.78) had statistically significant lower odds of surgical cancellation compared to NH-Black patients.

We also investigated sex differences in chronic pain differential gene expression. At the brain region level, we identified 2 chronic pain DEGs: B4GALT2 and VEGFB in dACC. At the cell level, we found more than 2000 chronic pain cell-type DEGs, significantly enriched in microglia of the basolateral amygdala. The findings were enriched for mouse microglia pain genes, and for hypoxia and immune response pathways. Small amounts of cross-trait DEG overlap in migraine and chronic pain highlighted medial amygdala cells, and in chronic pain and oxymorphone use suggested the amygdala as a key region. Chronic pain differential gene expression was not significantly different between men and women. Overall, chronic pain-associated gene expression is heterogeneous across region and cell type, is largely distinct from that in pain-related factors and migraine, and our results highlight BLA microglia as a key brain cell type in chronic pain.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40623285\/"},{"pmid":40623269,"journal":"Pain","title":"Diminished transient receptor vanilloid 1 on skin nerve fibers in painful bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy.","authors":"Jin Y; Aravamudhan A; Cebulla N; Schirmer D; Runau E; Flamm L; Terhorst C; Jahnel L; Guse J; Giordani N; Wieser A; Sodmann A; Blum R; Kittel RJ; Sommer C","abstract":"Bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN) is frequently accompanied by reduced thermal sensation and neuropathic pain.

We combined PGP9.5 and TRPV1 immunofluorescence labelling on skin biopsy sections from 67 individuals, 27 patients with BIPN without pain, 18 patients with BIPN with pain, and 22 healthy volunteers. A total of 332 bioimages were collected and quantified using objective image analysis. qPCR was used to measure TRPV1 mRNA in the skin. Quantitative sensory testing and pain questionnaires were used to gather clinical data. Transient receptor vanilloid 1 immunoreactivity appeared as distinct puncta along the nerve fibers. Its normalized mean fluorescence intensity (TRPV1\/PGP9.5 MFI) (P < 0.05) and TRPV1 puncta area (P < 0.001) were decreased in small nerve fibers of patients with BIPN, concomitantly with reduced thermal sensitivity. Further stratification based on pain symptoms demonstrated a greater reduction in TRPV1\/PGP9.5 MFI and severe impairment in thermal difference detection ability (TSL) and heat pain thresholds (HPT) in painful BIPN. Pain levels were negatively correlated with TRPV1\/PGP9.5 MFI in the epidermis and subepidermis (P < 0.001 r = -0.44; P < 0.001, r = -0.42), and with z-scores of TSL and HPT (P < 0.05; P < 0.05). Transient receptor vanilloid 1 mRNA levels in skin were not different between groups, indicating that cellular synthesis of TRPV1 was not altered. Diminished TRPV1 immunoreactivity on nerves of patients with BIPN with pain aligns with their insensitivity to thermal stimuli which may help to better understand the pathophysiology of pain in patients with BIPN.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40623269\/"},{"pmid":40623266,"journal":"Pain","title":"Spinal disk injury induces germinal center formation, pronociceptive antibody production, and chronic nociceptive sensitization in a male mouse back pain model.","authors":"Wei T; Guo TZ; Shi X; Li WW; Clark JD; Kingery WS","abstract":"Accumulating evidence suggests that spinal intervertebral disk damage is associated with activation of the adaptive immune system.

Sera collected up to 33 weeks after DP were purified for immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG intrathecal injections and antigen binding experiments. Spinal cords and disks were collected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western, and immunohistochemical analyses. Disk puncture injury in muMT mice had minimal effect, but in WT mice, it induced hindpaw allodynia, hyperalgesia, and grip weakness that gradually resolved after 6 months. Spinal cord expression of inflammatory cytokines and complement components was chronically upregulated after DP, peaking at 1 to 3 weeks. Increased IgM and IgG autoantigen binding and deposition in the spinal cord peaked at 10 to 20 weeks after DP injury. Lumbar lymph node immunostaining demonstrated B-cell germinal center formation beginning at 3 weeks and peaking at 10 to 20 weeks after DP injury. Intrathecal injection of IgM and IgG collected between 3 and 20 weeks after DP in WT mice was pronociceptive in muMT DP mice. Preemptive pharmacologic intervention targeting B cells had no effect on early nociceptive sensitization but reduced sensitization when administered at 10 weeks after DP injury in WT mice. Collectively, these data support the pronociceptive autoimmunity hypothesis for the transition from tissue injury to chronic musculoskeletal pain state.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40623266\/"},{"pmid":40623248,"journal":"Pain","title":"Identifying risk and protective factors in the transmission of chronic pain from mothers to children: a longitudinal cohort study.","authors":"Beveridge JK; Noel M; McArthur BA; Madigan S; Orr SL; McDonald S; Tough S; Birnie KA","abstract":"Chronic pain is common and can significantly affect the individual and their family. Indeed, children have an increased risk of developing chronic pain when one or both of their parents have it. However, many children of parents with chronic pain do not report pain problems. The aim of this longitudinal study was to identify psychosocial factors throughout childhood that either increased or decreased the odds for chronic pain among children of mothers with and without chronic pain. Participants were 1128 mother-child dyads from a community-based cohort. Mothers self-reported on their chronic pain when children were 5 and 8 years and on potential risk and protective factors (anxiety and depressive symptoms, parenting practices, social support, coping, and optimism) at various time points between child ages 8 and 11 years. Children self-reported on their chronic pain at 13 years and on potential protective factors (optimism, connections with adults and peers, and community engagement) at 12 years. Logistic regression and moderation analyses demonstrated that children had increased odds for chronic pain at 13 years when their mothers reported both chronic pain and greater anxiety symptoms or ineffective parenting practices earlier in childhood. No protective factors moderated the association between mother-child chronic pain; however, greater child optimism and connections with adults at 12 years lowered the odds of chronic pain for all children, regardless of maternal chronic pain. These findings highlight factors that can be targeted in prevention efforts to mitigate the risk of chronic pain, but future research is needed to explore additional protective factors.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40623248\/"},{"pmid":40623245,"journal":"Pain","title":"Subjective salience ratings are a reliable proxy for physiological measures of arousal.","authors":"Hadjis GE; Atlas LY; Mouseli P; Sexton CA; McAndrews MP; Moayedi M","abstract":"Pain is an inherently salient multidimensional experience that signals potential bodily threats and promotes nocifensive behaviours. Any stimulus can be salient depending on its features and context. This poses a challenge in delineating pain-specific processes in the brain, rather than salience-driven activity. It is thus essential to salience match control (innocuous) stimuli and noxious stimuli, to remove salience effects, when aiming to delineate pain-specific mechanisms. Previous studies have salience-matched either through subjective salience ratings or the skin conductance response (SCR). The construct of salience is not intuitive, and thus, matching through self-report poses challenges. SCR is used as a proxy measure that captures physiological arousal, which overcomes the nebulous construct of salience. However, SCR cannot be used to salience match in real time (ie, during an experiment) and assumes an association between salience and physiological arousal elicited by painful and non-painful stimuli, but this has not been explicitly tested. To determine whether salience and physiological arousal are associated, 41 healthy adults experienced 30 heat pain and 30 non-painful electric stimuli of varying intensities. Stimuli were subjectively matched for salience, and SCR was measured to each presentation. A linear mixed model found no differences in SCR between salience-matched heat and electric stimuli. A mediation analysis showed that salience fully mediated the relationship between stimulus intensity and SCR. In conclusion, salience and physiological arousal are associated, and subjective salience ratings are suitable for salience matching pain with non-painful stimuli. Future work can thus use subjective salience ratings to delineate pain-specific processes.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40623245\/"},{"pmid":40622860,"journal":"Anesthesiology","title":"Adverse events associated with airway management in pediatric anesthesia: A prospective, multicenter, observational Japan Pediatric Difficult Airway in Anesthesia (J-PEDIA) study.","authors":"Kojima T; Yamauchi Y; Watanabe F; Ichiyanagi S; Kobayashi Y; Kaiho Y; Toyama H; Kasuya S; Kuratani N; Suzuki Y","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of adverse events and desaturation during airway-securing procedures (a sequence from preoxygenation to completion of tracheal intubation or supraglottic airway placement) under general anesthesia in children remains underexplored.

Differences between groups were compared using time series analysis. RESULTS: Of 199 eligible and consenting patients who underwent surgery, 188 (94%) had complete follow-up. Median (interquartile range) nadir QoR-15 scores were 128 (93-145), 87 (70-102), and 70 (60-81) for the gastroscopy, intermediate, and cardiac surgery groups, respectively (P<0.001). Compared with the gastroscopy group (29.9 [29.9-29.9]), the median (IQR) DAH(30) was lower in both the intermediate (28.8 [26.1-29.1]) and cardiac (22.9 [18.9-24.1]) surgery groups (each P<0.001). There was an association between the QoR-15 nadir and DAH(30) (rho=0.52, P<0.001). Most patients were very satisfied or satisfied with the frequent text messaging. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery after surgery varies according to the extent of surgery and the presence of postoperative complications. Follow-up and measurement of recovery was highly valued by patients.

This study investigated the validity of the modified steep ramp test (SRT) for evaluating preoperative aerobic capacity and to evaluate its usefulness for preoperative risk assessment in patients planned for pancreatic surgery. METHODS: Patients scheduled for pancreatic surgery who preoperatively performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and the modified SRT within 14 days were included. To assess its criterion validity, the correlation between the achieved work rate at peak exercise (WR(peak)) at the modified SRT and oxygen uptake (VO(2)) at peak exercise (VO(2peak)) during CPET was determined. To evaluate the ability of the modified SRT to correctly classify patients as fit or unfit, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed based on the CPET VO(2peak) cutoff 18.0 ml.kg(-1).min(-1) and VO(2) at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) cutoff 11.0 ml.kg(-1).min(-1). RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (21 females) aged 68.7 +\/- 7.6 years were included. Modified SRT WR(peak) (W\/kg) demonstrated a very strong correlation with CPET VO(2peak) (rho = 0.865, r = 0.926). The modified SRT WR(peak) cutoff to most accurately classify patients as fit or unfit was 2.095 W\/kg for the CPET VO(2peak) cutoff (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.948) and the CPET VO(2) at the VAT cutoff (AUC of 0.814). CONCLUSIONS: The modified SRT is a valid short-term practical exercise test to preoperatively assess aerobic capacity in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. A modified SRT performance below 2.1 W\/kg seems clinically most suitable to select candidates for further preoperative CPET evaluation and\/or prehabilitation, given its positive and negative predictive value.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40617055\/"},{"pmid":39084703,"journal":"Regional anesthesia and pain medicine","title":"One-year opioid consumption trajectories among individuals receiving multidisciplinary postsurgical care: a single-center observational study from the Toronto General Hospital Transitional Pain Service.","authors":"Page MG; Katz J; Darville R; Gabriel G; Ladha KS; Huang A; Ganty P; Katznelson R; Tamir D; Fiorellino J; Kahn M; Tao L; Slepian M; Wieskopf J; Clarke H","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The Transitional Pain Service (TPS) is an innovative, personalized approach to postsurgical opioid consumption and pain management. The objectives of this study were to identify trajectories of opioid consumption and pain intensity within 12 months after initiating treatment through the TPS, identify biopsychosocial factors associated with trajectory membership, and examine the relationship between trajectory membership and other outcomes of interest over the same 12-month period. METHODS: Consecutive patients referred to the TPS were included in the present study (n=466). After providing informed consent, they completed self-report questionnaires at the initial visit at the TPS (either pre surgery or post surgery) and at every TPS visit until 12 months. Growth mixture modeling was used to derive trajectories and identify associated factors. RESULTS: Results showed three distinct opioid consumption trajectories for both presurgical opioid consumers and opioid-naive patients. These trajectories all decreased over time and among those who were consuming opioids before surgery that returned to presurgical levels. Being man, having a substance use disorder, or reporting higher levels of pain interference were associated with higher daily opioid consumption for presurgical opioid consumers. For presurgical opioid-naive individuals, higher opioid consumption trajectories were associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Five pain intensity trajectories were identified, and there were no significant association between opioid consumption and pain intensity trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that opioid consumption and pain intensity trajectories mostly decrease after surgery in a high-risk population enrolled in a TPS. Results also show heterogeneity in postsurgical recovery and highlight the importance of using personalized interventions to optimize individual trajectories.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/39084703\/"},{"pmid":38925712,"journal":"Regional anesthesia and pain medicine","title":"Pericapsular nerve group block: a 3D CT scan imaging study to determine the spread of injectate.","authors":"Balocco AL; Gautier N; Van Boxstael S; Lopez AM; Carella M; Corten K; Sala-Blanch X; Hadzic A; Gautier PE","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Current understanding of the mechanism of action of the pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block is primarily based on cadaver studies. We performed an imaging study in patients undergoing hip surgery to enhance the understanding of the analgesic mechanisms following a PENG block.

After completion of the block, a high-resolution CT scan was performed to obtain a three-dimensional reconstruction of the injectate's dispersion. RESULTS: The CT imaging revealed that injectate was mainly confined to the epimysium of the iliacus and the psoas muscle, with a minor spread to the hip capsule. Contrast dye was detected within the iliacus and\/or the psoas muscle in all patients. No observed spread to either the subpectineal plane or the obturator foramen was detected.

OBJECTIVE: This narrative review examines the clinical benefits of XR for navigation in various pain procedures. It defines key terms and concepts related to XR technology and explores characteristics of procedures that are most amenable to XR-based navigation. Finally, it suggests best practices for developing XR navigation systems and discusses the role of emerging technology in the future of XR in regional anesthesia and pain medicine. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A search was performed across PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for primary literature investigating the clinical benefits of XR navigation for pain procedures. FINDINGS: Thirteen studies using XR for procedural navigation are included. The evidence includes randomized controlled trials, retrospective studies, and case series. CONCLUSIONS: Early randomized controlled trials show potential for XR to improve procedural efficiency, but more comprehensive research is needed to determine if there are significant clinical benefits. Case reports demonstrate XR's utility in generating patient-specific navigation plans when difficult anatomy is encountered. Procedures that facilitate the generation and registration of XR images are most conducive to XR navigation, whereas those that rely on frequent re-imaging will continue to depend on traditional modes of navigation.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/38754990\/"},{"pmid":38697776,"journal":"Regional anesthesia and pain medicine","title":"Bilateral ultrasound-guided maxillary and mandibular combined nerves block reduces morphine consumption after double-jaw orthognathic surgery: a randomized controlled trial.","authors":"Esquerre T; Mure M; Minville V; Prevost A; Lauwers F; Ferre F","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Double-jaw surgeries are known to be painful and to require opioids.

METHODS: In this single-blind, randomized control study, 50 patients were prospectively allocated to either bilateral ultrasound-guided V2 and V3 combined nerves block or intraoral infiltration of local anesthetic. Primary outcome was the cumulative oral morphine equivalent (OME) consumption assessed at postoperative day 1. Secondary outcomes were cumulative OME consumption and pain scores in recovery room and at postoperative day 2, intraoperative anesthetic consumption, and opioid-related side effects. Preoperative anxiety was investigated by the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS). RESULTS: Compared with infiltration, ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia reduced cumulative OME consumption on day 1 (45.7+\/-37.6 mg vs 25.5+\/-19.8 mg, respectively, mean difference of -20.1 (95% CI -37.4 to -2.9) mg, p=0.023) and day 2 (64.5+\/-60 mg vs 35.8+\/-30.2 mg, respectively, mean difference of -28.7 (95% CI -55.9 to -1.43) mg, p=0.040).

Autonomic nervous system imbalance, characterised by sympathetic hyperactivation and low parasympathetic tone, can occur during the perioperative period. These changes drive systemic stress responses, cardiovascular instability, impaired tissue repair, and immunosuppression, which in turn increase infection risk, neurocognitive decline, and multiorgan dysfunction. Surgical trauma, anaesthesia, pain, hypothermia, and psychological stressors all contribute to this dysregulation, and consequently low parasympathetic tone results in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway being less effective. High sympathetic nervous system activity promotes catecholamine surges and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Pharmacological interventions, including dexmedetomidine and beta-blockers, together with nonpharmacological strategies, such as electroacupuncture and temperature management, are measures that have potential to restore ANS balance. This systematic review covers ANS-mediated organ regulation, pathophysiological consequences of perioperative dysautonomia, and evidence-based therapeutic strategies. By integrating findings from multiple basic and clinical studies, the pivotal roles of ANS modulation in mitigating postoperative complications, including neurocognitive disorders, immunosuppression, and cancer recurrence, are discussed. Maintaining balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems is an important prospect in perioperative medicine that could benefit surgical patients' short- or long-term recovery.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40615330\/"},{"pmid":40615329,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Artificial intelligence for electrocardiographic diagnosis of perioperative myocardial ischaemia: a scoping review.","authors":"Kim A; Chatterjee M; Iansavitchene A; Komeili M; Chan ADC; Yang H; Chui J","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Perioperative electrocardiographic monitoring can offer immediate detection of myocardial ischaemia, yet its application in perioperative and remote monitoring settings is hampered by frequent false alarms and signal contamination.

Complications related to IDDS include mechanical\/device malfunction, intrathecal catheter problems, infections, and provider errors. These issues often require urgent surgical intervention, IDDS removal, and abrupt discontinuation of the analgesic infusion. In these scenarios, the safe and effective transition to alternative opioid delivery routes such as intravenous or oral administration is critical. However, an accurate calculation of equianalgesic doses to ensure adequate pain control while minimizing the risk of withdrawal is not well documented. CASE REPORT: A patient in their 60s with a complex medical history, including chronic low back pain managed with IDDS for 30 years, presented with severe pain unresponsive to dose adjustments. Imaging revealed a catheter-related granuloma at thoracic 8 level, leading to intrathecal therapy discontinuation. A rapid weaning protocol reduced the intrathecal morphine dose by 10% daily, transitioning to systemic opioids based on pain severity and short-acting opioid needs. The final intrathecal-to-oral morphine conversion ratio by the time the pump was empty on day 10 was approximately 1:10. CONCLUSION: Current guidelines for intrathecal-to-systemic opioid conversion vary widely, with outdated literature suggesting a 1:300 ratio, whereas real-world cases report ratios between 1:2.5 and 1:70.

In both rural and urban areas with less access to health care resources, a sustainable health care system must focus on delivering value-based care and prioritizing population health, promoting efficiency, preventing complications, and optimizing outcomes. Given the shortage of primary care physicians, and the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, which emphasized the importance of a systems-based approach, as well as the evolving roles in the perioperative surgical home and ERAS pathways, anesthesiologists are in a prime position to contribute to these essential value-based objectives. They can achieve this by playing a more active role in the preoperative evaluation and optimization of patients.This paper presents a comprehensive review of pertinent perioperative medical conditions (obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, anemia, food insecurity and nutrition, diabetes, cognitive and brain health) that can be optimized before surgery. It highlights the latest research and innovations in preoperative management that can significantly alter intraoperative anesthetic management of these conditions leading to reduced morbidity and mortality among surgical patients. Furthermore, this paper highlights existing gaps in preoperative management, particularly in the optimization of comorbid medical conditions.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40608563\/"},{"pmid":40623293,"journal":"Pain","title":"Reliability and validity of the Pediatric PainSCAN: a screening tool for pediatric neuropathic pain and complex regional pain syndrome.","authors":"Mesaroli G; Davis AM; Perruccio AV; Davidge KM; Campbell F; Sun N; Walker SM; Hess CW; Simons LE; Logan D; Stinson JN","abstract":"The Pediatric PainSCAN is the first screening tool for neuropathic pain (NP) and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) designed for pediatrics.

This study aimed to evaluate the tool's reliability and validity. A multicentre cross-sectional survey was administered to participants with NP, CRPS, and other pain conditions in pediatric chronic pain clinics. Test-retest reliability was evaluated by readministering the tool after 7 days. Criterion validity (sensitivity [SE] and specificity [SP]) was evaluated by comparing participant scores to a clinician diagnosis. Convergent validity was evaluated by comparing participant scores on the tool to existing NP screening tools.

However, studies are mixed on their effectiveness in decreasing postoperative opioid consumption. A more comprehensive analysis is necessary to understand if peripheral nerve blocks reduce postoperative opioid exposure and risk for opioid dependence. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated electronic health record data for adults undergoing orthopaedic surgery with general anaesthesia from 2016 to 2020 at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Linear models were fitted on propensity-weighted data to characterise the association between single injection peripheral nerve blocks and clinical outcomes. Our primary outcomes were maximum pain score and cumulative opioid dose, quantified in morphine milligram equivalents, administered in the PACU. Post-discharge outcomes associated with pain and opioid consumption were also evaluated. RESULTS: Among 22 956 patients, peripheral nerve block administration was associated with lower maximum pain scores and lower probability of opioid administration in the PACU. However, it was associated with higher maximum pain scores and a 22.7% increase in opioid consumption during the hospital stay. Peripheral nerve blocks were associated with an increase in opioid prescriptions at 30 days after discharge, but no increase at 90 or 180 days, and with decreased chronic pain diagnoses 1 yr after operation. CONCLUSIONS: Although single injection peripheral nerve blocks were effective in reducing immediate postoperative pain and opioid consumption, they were associated with greater opioid consumption that could increase the risk for opioid dependence. Standardised protocols to mitigate the risk for rebound pain could help minimise postoperative opioid exposure.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40610285\/"},{"pmid":40609218,"journal":"Journal of clinical anesthesia","title":"Pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block compared to intrathecal morphine for analgesic efficacy in total hip arthroplasty: A placebo-controlled randomized double-blind non-inferiority trial.","authors":"Oremus K; Trkulja V; Gasparini G; Sostaric S; Cicak N; Haspl M; Mihaljevic S","abstract":"BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block was non-inferior to intrathecal (IT) morphine regarding analgesia after total hip arthroplasty (THA) with no untoward effects on the motor function. METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial, patients undergoing unilateral THA under spinal anesthesia were randomized to receive a PENG block (20 mL 0.5 % levobupivacaine +2 mg dexamethasone) or IT morphine (100 mug). They received multimodal oral postoperative analgesia with rescue intravenous morphine for breakthrough pain, and were repeatedly evaluated for pain over the first 48 postoperative hours using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS), and for the straight leg raise test at 4, 6 and 12 h. Co-primary outcomes were (i) maximum pain at rest and (ii) at active hip flexion - estimated for the overall period based on three consecutive scores - and (iii) milligram morphine equivalents (MME) delivered over 48 h. Non-inferiority margins for the PENG block - IT morphine differences were 0.75 NRS points for the pain scores, and 10 for the cumulative MME (corresponds to one 4 mg intravenous morphine rescue dose).

OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to: 1) measure the reliability of seven of those 14 EPAs using entrustment data collected via a mobile web application (Web App) and 2) examine implementation and utility of the EPA Web App. METHODS: Web App design prioritized a simple and efficient user interface, and incorporated revisions based on feedback. Assessments were completed during the 2020-2021 academic year. Generalizability theory was used to examine the distribution of EPA global scores. Qualitative interview data of Web App usage by participants focused on domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. RESULTS: The Web App was used in a total of 1116 observations in 31 residents. Two EPAs were effective in discriminating differences in resident performance, whereas two were not. With 24 observations, one of the EPAs had a G coefficient of 0.68 and phi coefficient of 0.66 approaching a level suitable for formative feedback, whereas the other EPAs did not reach the 0.7 threshold (for moderate reliability in formative assessment, not summative use) even with 24 observations. Several constructs were elicited from the interview data in the domains of intervention characteristics, individual characteristics, outer setting, and inner setting. CONCLUSION: The utility of the Web App for EPA assessment was deemed positive for formative, low-stakes assessment. EPAs may not all necessarily be able to discriminate differences in resident performance. However, even a single EPA assessment may still be useful as one component of competency-based medical education via programmatic assessment.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40609217\/"},{"pmid":40602807,"journal":"Regional anesthesia and pain medicine","title":"Practice advisory for intravenous management of headache disorders in hospitalized patients: a review of the evidence and consensus recommendations.","authors":"Hoydonckx Y; Feoktistov A; Amoozegar F; Anderson CC; Barad M; Burke E; Chitsantikul P; Doshi TL; Englesakis M; Goel A; Gupta H; Kissoon N; Kirschner A; Kohan L; Lauritsen CG; Miller F; Monsour D; Nader A; Ogunlaja O; Schuster N; Schwenk ES; Silberstein SD; Souza D; Yuan H; Narouze S","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Patients hospitalized for headache treatment pose unique challenges to the healthcare system. Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based guidance on management. This practice advisory aims to fill this critical gap by systematically reviewing the existing literature and providing comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for managing headache patients during hospitalization. METHODS: In February 2023, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine approved this practice advisory proposal. The steering committee selected committee members based on clinical and research expertise in the field of headache medicine. Nine questions were formulated by the committee, and each question was assigned to a group composed of 3-4 members. A systematic literature search for each question was performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science on June 21, 2023. The results from each search were imported into separate Covidence projects for screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Additionally, relevant systematic reviews (SR) were screened. Each group submitted a structured narrative review along with statements and recommendations based on the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) format for grading of evidence. While the USPSTF framework was used, including the language in the recommendations, the formal USPSTF methodology, including the SR with meta-analysis and summary tables with forest plots, was not followed because of low overall evidence quality. The interim draft was shared electronically with each collaborator, who was requested to vote anonymously using two rounds of the modified Delphi approach. A consensus recommendation required >75% agreement. RESULTS: The panel generated 12 statements and 17 recommendations, along with their strength and certainty of evidence. Following two rounds of Delphi voting, a high consensus was achieved for all statements and recommendations. Most statements received a low-to-moderate level of certainty, and all but one recommendation received grade B or C, which was consistent with the lack of randomized controlled trials supporting most of the drugs in this document. CONCLUSIONS: This evidence-based practice advisory provides a foundational step toward standardizing inpatient headache care and highlights existing gaps in the literature that should be addressed through rigorous prospective randomized studies.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40602807\/"},{"pmid":40602806,"journal":"Regional anesthesia and pain medicine","title":"Postsurgical Medication Awareness, Recovery, and Tracking using a Phone-Based App (SMART-APP): a randomized clinical trial.","authors":"Rolfzen ML; Shah K; Sanchez Rodriguez E; Hoffman JT; Clauw D; Mascha E; Graff V; Bartels K","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Excess postoperative opioid use is harmful. We tested the hypothesis that a patient-facing educational smartphone app would permit surgical patients to effectively manage their pain while using fewer opioids after discharge. METHODS: A two-hospital, single-health system trial randomly exposed adult surgical inpatients to a consumer electronic health app (\"educational app\") that provided pain education or to a data collection only app (\"control app\"). During the second half of the trial, a clinician-facing electronic decision-support tool was activated. Linear regression models with log-transformed outcomes estimated the effect of the educational app on the primary outcome of cumulative self-reported opioid use within 4 weeks after discharge (in morphine milligram equivalents (MME)) and the secondary outcome of opioids prescribed at discharge. RESULTS: We enrolled 711 patients from May 2, 2022, to December 10, 2023. The modified intention-to-treat analysis cohort included 606 patients, with 303 randomized to the educational app and 303 to the control app. Median (first quartile, third quartile) discharge opioids prescribed to both groups were 75 (60, 150) MME.

Devices such as those pulse oximetry-based have been available and studied over the past decade with varying results on their accuracy. We recently developed a first-of-its-kind near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) based algorithm to measure tHb continuously and noninvasively. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the NIRS based tHb algorithm using a cerebral oximetry sensor. METHODS: We performed a post hoc retrospective analysis of data collected during cardiac surgery from 3 clinical sites. Both NIRS data and blood gas tHb data were collected. Then the NIRS data was postprocessed through the NIRS based tHb algorithm to generate continuous measurement of tHb. Comparison between the 2 tHb measurements was assessed using the Bland-Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), 4-quadrant concordance, and error-grid analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-nine (189) patients were included in the analysis. The bias (or mean difference) and precision (or 1 standard deviation of the difference) (95% confidence interval) are 0.08 (0.02-0.19) g\/dL and 1.01 (0.93-1.09) g\/dL, respectively.

METHODS: A single-center, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial included 76 patients undergoing elective lumbar spinal fusion. Participants received either bilateral ESPB with ropivacaine or placebo (normal saline) after surgery. The primary outcome was pain intensity 1-hour postanesthesia, measured using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Secondary outcomes included opioid consumption in the first 12 hours, time to first opioid use, quality of recovery, and pain intensity and opioid use at 30 days. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: The mean NRS 1-hour postanesthesia did not differ significantly between the ropivacaine and placebo group (3.8 +\/- 3 vs 4. 2 +\/- 2.6, P = .56).

Non-Invasive Venous waveform Analysis (NIVA) has demonstrated significant sensitivity in detecting acute hemorrhage with 8-10 % blood volume loss. To determine whether NIVA can accurately and non-invasively detect lower volumes of blood loss, we performed a prospective observational study using a digital blood volume monitor at an American Red Cross (ARC) donation center to assess NIVA's performance at lower blood volume loss. METHODS: Venous waveforms were successfully captured in 33 ARC-approved patients. Waveforms were recorded for the duration of whole blood donation and then transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain. The ratiometric power contribution of the cardiac frequencies was used to calculate a representative volume status value, the IntraVAscular Number (IVAN). RESULTS: A significant decrease in the IVAN output was observed after just 200 mL (3-4 % blood volume) of whole blood donation (p < 0.05). The ROC curve demonstrated an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.65 for the ability of delta IVAN to detect 200 mL of blood loss. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated an AUC of 0.91 for the ability of delta IVAN to detect 500 mL of blood loss. CONCLUSION: There remains a large unmet need for accurate and timely detection of acute hemorrhage. This study supports the potential application of NIVA in the detection of acute low-volume human blood loss. NIVA is a novel technology that uses previously undetectable low-amplitude venous signals of the cardiac pulse, which may prove useful for more accurate and early detection of acute hemorrhage.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40532359\/"},{"pmid":40532358,"journal":"Journal of clinical anesthesia","title":"Opioid-free anaesthesia protocol based on thoracic paravertebral block enhances postoperative recovery after breast cancer surgery: A two-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.","authors":"Tong P; Guo Y; Wang Y; Feng Y; Song X; Luo G; Qin W; Lu X; Zheng L; Wang H; Lu Y; Lai R","abstract":"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the implementation of an opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) protocol based on thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) could improve early postoperative recovery quality in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.

Meta-regression, sensitivity analyses, and assessment of risk of bias were also undertaken. MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-nine trials encompassing 5794 pediatric patients were included. In the primary analysis, only mask acceptance could be evaluated. Combinations of dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and ketamine demonstrated the highest probabilities of satisfactory mask acceptance, with intranasal administration at shorter premedication intervals (15-30 min) showing greater efficacy. Clonidine, melatonin, and diazepam were comparatively less effective. In the secondary analysis, mask acceptance, intravenous cannulation acceptance, and parental separation acceptance yielded similar findings, with pharmacological combinations based on dexmedetomidine and midazolam ranking highest, while clonidine, melatonin, and diazepam remained less effective. CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine-, midazolam-, and ketamine-based combinations offer superior preoperative cooperation in pediatric patients, as demonstrated by higher success rates of mask acceptance, intravenous cannulation acceptance, and parental separation acceptance. Routes, doses, and timing are critical factors influencing success.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40517567\/"},{"pmid":40516197,"journal":"Journal of clinical anesthesia","title":"Application of deep learning-based facial pain recognition model for postoperative pain assessment.","authors":"Zhang JT; Hu XY; Duan W; Ji MH; Yang JJ","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain is a common and complex issue that affects patients' recovery and the quality of healthcare. Traditional pain assessment methods-primarily based on self-reporting and clinical observation-are often inadequate, particularly for patients with communication impairments. Deep learning technology offers new opportunities for automatic pain assessment. However, progress in this area is hindered by the limited availability of high-quality clinical datasets and a paucity of studies addressing real-world model deployment. This gap between laboratory research and clinical application requires further study. METHODS: The study constructed two distinct datasets to capture both clinical and laboratory scenarios. The Clinical Pain Dataset (CPD) includes 3411 facial pain images from 503 postoperative patients, while Simulated Pain Dataset (SPD) contains 1038 images from 51 volunteers. The two datasets were combined to form the Combined Dataset (CD). A pre-trained VGG16 model was used for training and validation. The model's performance on different datasets and pain levels was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and F1 scores. RESULTS: In the CPD and CD, the model demonstrated its highest performance in identifying severe pain, achieving AUROC values of 0.898 (95 %CI,0.877-0.917) and 0.867 (95 %CI,0.844-0.889), respectively. For overall evaluation, the highest AUROC values were observed in CPD-train (0.898 [95 % CI: 0.877-0.917]) and CD-train (0.917 [95 % CI: 0.883-0.948]) for severe pain classification. Building on these results, a facial pain recognition software was developed based on the model, offering a new option for clinical pain identification. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that deep learning models leveraging facial expression analysis hold significant potential to recognize varying degrees of pain in clinical settings, especially severe pain. In the future, they could help anesthesiologists monitor postoperative patients' pain levels in real-time, enhancing the quality of medical services.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40516197\/"},{"pmid":40513143,"journal":"Journal of clinical anesthesia","title":"Preoperative low-dose dexmedetomidine reduces postoperative delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture under spinal anesthesia: A randomized, double blind, controlled clinical study.","authors":"Geng P; Shang Z; Cheng F; Zhang Y; Deng X; Chen X; Zhan L; Zheng L; Liu X","abstract":"STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of preoperative low-dose dexmedetomidine administration for one night on the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture.

DESIGN: Systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) including meta-analyses, meta-regression, trial sequential analyses (TSA) and GRADE methodology. SETTING: Online databases (Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; Scopus; Web of Science; and international trial registries) were searched for RCTs up to December 2022. PATIENTS: Adult patients undergoing shoulder surgery following ultrasound-guided brachial plexus blockade, where incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis was reported. INTERVENTIONS: Diaphragm-sparing techniques following ultrasound-guided brachial plexus blockade were included: modifications of ISB (low-volume, extrafascial, and lower concentration); superior trunk block; supraclavicular brachial plexus block, infraclavicular brachial plexus block; costoclavicular brachial plexus block; and anterior and posterior approaches to the suprascapular nerve block. MEASUREMENTS: The primary endpoint was the incidence of complete hemidiaphragmatic paralysis. Secondary endpoints included postoperative analgesia and safety-related outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-eight RCTs involving 1737 subjects were identified. Of these, 22 were eligible for meta-analysis. Six regional techniques were analysed. The low-volume technique significantly reduced the incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis as compared with the conventional ISB (risk ratio 0.62; 95 % CI 0.42 to 0.91; p = 0.02; absolute risk difference - 0.30 [95 % CI -0.39 to -0.20]; I(2) = 80 %) at short-term follow-up. TSA confirmed the results of this meta-analysis but did not reach the required sample size by 19.5 %, indicating that the result was not definitive. The combined infraclavicular-suprascapular blocks, the extrafascial technique, the lower concentration technique, and the supraclavicular block reduced the incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis by 97 %, 64 %, 57 % and 46 %, respectively.

They note that case reports detailing complications typically utilize at least 1 mL of air, frequently exceeding this amount. Even a 1-mL dosage surpasses the requirement, particularly when fluoroscopy is applied in the context of chronic pain management. The proponents also suggest a modified technique, where a syringe containing a drop of saline or contrast acts as a visual cue, minimizing air injection into the epidural space to a negligible quantity. Moreover, they emphasize that air facilitates the identification of any fluid as an indicator of unintended intrathecal access. The Con perspective argues against the utilization of air for epidural access and advocates for the use of LOR with saline instead. This stance is supported by evidence pointing to a greater occurrence of adverse events, such as postdural puncture headache (PDPH) and pneumocephalus, associated with LOR to air compared to LOR with saline. They also argue that saline's physical properties enhance tactile feedback, potentially contributing to its increased safety. Both saline and air have been used for many years for epidural access via the interlaminar approach. Although both are generally accepted in practice, neither has been formally established as the standard of care. It would benefit the medical community to further delineate the pros and cons of each medium, enabling practitioners to make more informed decisions. This Pro-Con debate will provide 2 perspectives ( Table ) on the evidence and rationales for the use of air or saline for the LOR technique in interlaminar epidural access with fluoroscopy.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40493784\/"},{"pmid":40479950,"journal":"Journal of clinical anesthesia","title":"Understanding preoperative concerns and attitudes towards prehabilitation in older surgical populations: A survey study.","authors":"Li M; Yan E; Saripella A; Alhamdah Y; Nabipoor M; Alibhai SMH; Wong J; Chung F","abstract":"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify common preoperative concerns in older surgical populations and explore their attitudes towards prehabilitation, functional, and cognitive assessments. DESIGN: Multicenter cross-sectional study. SETTING: Preoperative questionnaire examining preoperative concerns and attitudes towards prehabilitation, functional, and cognitive assessments. PATIENTS: 236 non-cardiac surgical patients >\/=65 years old. MEASUREMENTS: Concerns across five domains-surgery, anesthesia, functional status, cognitive status, and financial burden-were measured on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 'not concerned at all' to 'very concerned.' Attitudes towards prehabilitation and preoperative assessments were assessed on a five-point scale from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree.' Exploratory factor analysis identified concerns, and confirmatory factor analysis validated them. Reliability was assessed with Cronbach's alpha, and model fit was evaluated using the root mean square error of approximation, comparative fit index, and related indices. RESULTS: Surgical concerns were highest (2.5 +\/- 1.2), particularly regarding postoperative pain, surgical failure, and complications. Concerns about anesthesia (2.0 +\/- 1.3) and functional status (1.9 +\/- 1.3) followed, with lower concerns about cognitive status (1.5 +\/- 1.1) and financial burden (1.4 +\/- 0.9). Attitudes towards prehabilitation were generally positive. Most participants were open to functional assessments and training programs, though only 37 % were willing to undergo memory assessment.

Confirmatory factor analysis supported this structure with adequate model fit. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights common preoperative concerns among older adults, particularly regarding surgery, anesthesia, and functional status, with greater concern reported by those with functional dependence. While attitudes towards prehabilitation were generally positive, there was low willingness to undergo preoperative memory testing.

DAGs have been created for the exposure-outcome relationships between frailty, multimorbidity, and delirium (as an exposure) with postoperative outcomes (length of hospital stay, delirium, morbidity, mortality). DAGs were created following the approach of 'Evidence synthesis for constructing directed acyclic graphs', and revised after independent clinical expert input. RESULTS: DAGs provide visual representations of assumptions made, and provide an objective approach to appropriate statistical adjustments. Key nodes within all the DAGs included age, dementia, genetic predisposition, hearing and visual impairment, length of stay, malignancy, operative severity, polypharmacy, postoperative perioperative medicine service, preoperative clinic review, sex, social deprivation, urgency, with delirium, frailty, multimorbidity, interaction, morbidity acting as exposures, or outcomes in certain DAGs. CONCLUSIONS: DAGs provide a transparent framework for statistical decision-making in observational research. We provide an overview of DAGs using the SNAP-3 DAGs as examples to explain fundamental concepts for developing and using causal diagrams. This overview acknowledges the complexities of exploring clinical relationships and the assumptions that are necessary, providing an opportunity for critique of the relationships described and refinements for future studies.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40425394\/"},{"pmid":40424777,"journal":"Journal of clinical anesthesia","title":"Impact of daily, weekly, and seasonal surgical timing on postoperative outcomes in high-risk patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery: A retrospective, single-center study.","authors":"Sim JH; Park YS; Park B; Choi Y; Lim JS; Ha S; Kim JU","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Limited knowledge exists on the impact of surgical start timing on outcomes in high-risk patients. This study assessed its association with mortality, morbidity, and healthcare resource utilization in elective non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary medical center, including 14,394 high-risk patients (ASA >\/= 3) undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery from 2012 to 2021. Patients were grouped by surgical start time into detailed time intervals (8:00-11:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m., 1:00-3:00 p.m., 3:00-6:00 p.m.) and broader periods (morning vs. afternoon). Weekly (Monday-Wednesday vs. Thursday-Friday) and seasonal (spring, summer, fall, winter) variations were analyzed. Cox and logistic regression models assessed mortality, complications, and healthcare utilization. RESULTS: Afternoon surgeries were associated with higher mortality at 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.28, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.57, P = 0.016), 180 days (aHR: 1.30, 95 % CI: 1.12-1.51, P < 0.001), and 1 year (aHR: 1.26, 95 % CI: 1.13-1.40, P < 0.001), as well as overall mortality (aHR: 1.16, 95 % CI: 1.09-1.23, P < 0.001). Afternoon surgeries were also linked to higher composite complications (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.21, 95 % CI: 1.11-1.33, P < 0.001) along with higher intensive care unit admission (aOR: 1.40, 95 % CI: 1.28-1.52, P < 0.001) and red blood cell transfusion (aOR: 1.40, 95 % CI: 1.22-1.61, P < 0.001). Surgeries starting between 3:00 and 6:00 p.m. had the highest risk of 1-year mortality (aHR: 1.33, 95 % CI: 1.15-1.54, P < 0.001) and composite complications (aOR: 1.32, 95 % CI: 1.17-1.50, P < 0.001). Seasonal analysis showed higher 30-day (aHR: 1.80, 95 % CI: 1.08-2.99, P = 0.023) and 90-day mortality (aHR: 1.32, 95 % CI: 1.00-1.74, P = 0.048) in summer, and higher overall mortality (aHR: 1.10, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.19, P = 0.030) in winter. Subgroup analyses revealed variability by surgical type. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical start timing was significantly associated with postoperative outcomes in high-risk patients, underscoring the need for strategic scheduling.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40424777\/"},{"pmid":40414168,"journal":"Journal of clinical anesthesia","title":"Management of SGLT2i-associated perioperative ketoacidosis (SAPKA) \/ Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis (EDKA).","authors":"Wen LY","abstract":"This infographic reviews the risk of perioperative euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EKDA) associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), which is more specifically called SGLT2i-associated perioperative ketoacidosis (SAPKA)(1).

We compared the risk of pulmonary aspiration in children using three different recommendations for clear fluid fasting. METHODS: In this prospective multicentre cohort study, centres with >1000 paediatric anaesthesia cases per year were eligible. Regurgitation events, whether they were transient or led to consequences affecting postoperative care, were reported in detail. All centres also reported the number of anaesthetised children per year and which preoperative fasting regimen they used. RESULTS: The 31 participating centres contributed a total of 306 900 anaesthetic procedures. The incidence of confirmed pulmonary aspiration was 1.18:10 000 in the sip-til-send group, 0.96:10 000 in the >\/=1 h group, and 1.83:10 000 in the control group.

Although epidural blood patch (EBP) remains the most effective treatment, less invasive alternatives are being explored. We assessed the efficacy and safety of tetracosactide, a synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone analogue, for treating established PDPH in postpartum patients. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in two tertiary care maternal hospitals. Postpartum patients with PDPH after neuraxial anaesthesia were randomised to receive either tetracosactide 1 mg i.v. or placebo. The primary outcome was the rate of EBP within the 15-day follow-up. Secondary outcomes included headache duration and intensity, activity limitation, length of hospital stay, and the number of EBPs performed per patient. Interim analysis to determine futility and trial termination was planned at 50% enrolment. RESULTS: At interim analysis with 44 patients enrolled (23 in the treatment group and 21 in the placebo group) no significant difference was found for the primary outcome: 21 (91%) patients in the treatment group and 18 (86%) patients in the placebo group received EBP (P=0.6575). Secondary outcomes were comparable between groups, except for a 1-day longer hospital stay in the treatment group (P=0.0486). The study was terminated because of futility. No side-effects of tetracosactide administration were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of tetracosactide did not demonstrate efficacy in preventing EBP needs in postpartum PDPH, and there was no effect on the intensity, duration of headaches, and physical activity limitations. Given these findings, adrenocorticotropic hormone analogues should not be considered for this indication.

However, comprehensive perioperative medicine services are not yet uniformly available. This survey addressed the current state of perioperative medicine services for older surgical patients in the UK and ROI and how these services align with current national guidance. METHODS: A survey was distributed electronically to all publicly administered UK and ROI hospitals performing surgical procedures. The survey examined perioperative care against national recommendations regarding service organisation and conduct. RESULTS: Of 339 eligible hospitals, 54.9% (186\/339) responded. A hospital frailty lead was appointed in 54% (101\/186) of hospitals, and 9% (16\/186) had a designated anaesthetist for cognitive impairment. Hospital anaesthetic services outside the theatre were focused on preoperative assessment clinics (146\/172), with few reporting routine postoperative involvement (17\/166). Nurse-led preoperative assessments of frailty, cognition, and delirium risk were conducted in 49.5% (90\/182), 44.3% (78\/176), and 13.7% (24\/175) of hospitals, respectively. The Clinical Frailty Scale was used in 87.0% (147\/169) of hospitals for frailty screening. The 4 'A's Test (45.7% [85\/186]) and Abbreviated Mental Test (43.0% [80\/186]) were the preferred cognitive assessment tools. CONCLUSIONS: The survey highlights the variation in perioperative medicine services that exist for older surgical patients despite national guidelines advocating their widespread implementation. Opportunity exists to develop interspecialty perioperative services further and promote identification of frailty, cognitive impairment, and delirium, all of which negatively impact postoperative outcomes for older surgical patients.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/40389332\/"},{"pmid":40379536,"journal":"British journal of anaesthesia","title":"Perioperative management of patients taking glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) multidisciplinary consensus statement.","authors":"Oprea AD; Ostapenko LJ; Sweitzer B; Selzer A; Irizarry-Alvarado JM; Hurtado Andrade MD; Mendez CE; Kelley KD; Stewart E; Fernandez Robles CR; Chadha RM; Camilleri M; Mathur R; Umpierrez GE; Hepner DL","abstract":"The perioperative management of patients using glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists remains a topic of debate.

We hypothesised that multimodal prehabilitation, incorporating high-intensity respiratory muscle training, before lung resection would reduce postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicentre, randomised controlled trial (NCT04826575) to examine the effect of prehabilitation in individuals undergoing lung resection. Participants were defined as high-risk for postoperative pulmonary complications if they achieved V(E)\/VCO(2) slope >\/=33, as determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Participants were then randomised to either usual care or multimodal prehabilitation, which consisted of a 14-day programme of high-intensity respiratory muscle training, smoking cessation, nutritional support, and psychological support. The primary outcome were postoperative pulmonary and cardiovascular complications (pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation, adult respiratory distress syndrome, prolonged air leak). RESULTS: A total of 122 patients (46% female; age range: 64-75 yr) completed the study. Postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in 20\/58 (34%) of patients randomised to multimodal prehabilitation, compared with 35\/64 (55%) patients receiving usual care (odds ratio 2.29 [95% confidence interval 1.10-4.77]; P=0.029).

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled women >\/=18 yr of age receiving epidural analgesia during labour, excluding those with pre-existing fever, antibiotic therapy, or immunodeficiency. Allele scores were constructed from genotyping the C-allele frequency at variants rs6743376 and rs1542176; more copies of each allele independently raise IL-1Ra. The composite primary outcome was maternal intrapartum fever (>38 degrees C) or administration of intrapartum antibiotics after epidural placement.

However, the impact of repeat-dose glucocorticoids has not been studied in high-pain-response patients receiving pre-operative high-dose glucocorticoids. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect on pain of an oral dose of dexamethasone after total knee arthroplasty in selected high-pain-response patients who had received a pre-operative high dose of intravenous dexamethasone (1 mg kg -1 ). DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority study. SETTING: A multicentre study conducted at two major arthroplasty centres in Denmark from November 2021 to March 2024. PATIENTS: One hundred and ten patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty who had received multimodal analgesia including pre-operative intravenous dexamethasone 1 mg kg -1 . Selection criteria included a Pain Catastrophising Scale score greater than 20 and moderate-to-severe pain (VAS >30) during walking 24 h postoperatively. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised to either oral dexamethasone 24 mg or placebo on postoperative day 1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients experiencing moderate-to-severe pain during walking at 48 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores at various time points within 1 week postoperatively, rescue analgesics, quality of sleep, length of hospital stay and morbidity with follow-up at 30 days. RESULTS: At 48 h postoperatively, 65% of patients in the dexamethasone group and 79% in the placebo group reported moderate-to-severe pain during walking: odds ratio 0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20 to 1.16]; P  = 0.100.
