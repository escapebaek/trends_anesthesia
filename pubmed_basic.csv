Br J Anaesth 1997; 78:606-17 Major surgery is still associated with undesirable sequelae such as pain, cardiopulmonary, infective and thromboembolic complications, cerebral dysfunction, nausea and gastrointestinal paralysis, fatigue, and prolonged convalescence. The key pathogenic factor in postoperative morbidity, excluding failures of surgical and anesthetic technique, is the surgical stress response with subsequent increased demands on organ function. These changes in organ function are thought to be mediated by trauma-induced endocrine metabolic changes and activation of several biologic cascade systems (cytokines, complement, arachidonic acid metabolites, nitric oxide, free oxygen radicals, among others). To understand postoperative morbidity, it is therefore necessary to understand the pathophysiologic role of the various components of the surgical stress response and to determine whether modification of such responses may improve surgical outcome. While no single technique or drug regimen has been shown to eliminate postoperative morbidity and mortality, multimodal interventions may lead to a major reduction in the undesirable sequelae of surgical injury with improved recovery and reduction in postoperative morbidity and overall costs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40626746/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

40615331,British journal of anaesthesia,Population-based multistate modelling of peritraumatic opioid use among trauma patients from the Norwegian Trauma Registry.,Engel S; Rosseland LA; Smits M; Skurtveit SO; Gran JM; Nordseth T; Roise O; Jacobsen HB,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies document high rates of long-term opioid use (LTU) among trauma patients, without accounting for opioid prescription doses, frequency, and medical indications. Using detailed LTU criteria, this study aimed to construct a multistate model of peritraumatic opioid use and elucidate reasons for posttraumatic LTU. METHODS: This population-based cohort study links data from the 2015-2018 cohorts in the Norwegian Trauma Registry (n=24 224) with outpatient medication prescription records from the Norwegian Prescription Database for 1 yr before and 2 yr after injury. LTU was assigned upon receiving >/=900 morphine milligram equivalents within 90 days and another opioid prescription 91-180 days after any initial prescription; it ended after 180 days without opioid prescriptions, emigration, or death. Prescriptions to patients with LTU in the year after injury were screened for chronic pain and palliative care reimbursement codes, and for opioid maintenance treatment preparations. RESULTS: Posttraumatic opioid prescriptions primarily increased as a result of short-term opioid use (STU), peaking at 38.2% and returning to pre-injury levels (5.4%) within 6 months. Increases in LTU were smaller (4.3% to 6.7%). Among patients with LTU in the year after injury (n=1946), 47.4% exhibited LTU and 18.3% STU in the 6 months pre-injury. Moreover, 36.0% were reimbursed for chronic pain medications, 5.9% for palliative care, and 13.1% received opioid maintenance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, most patients with posttraumatic long-term opioid use had used opioids before injury, underscoring the need to address such use to minimise posttraumatic long-term opioid use. Few patients with long-term opioid use received palliative care or opioid maintenance treatment, indicating subacute and chronic pain as primary indications. As long-term opioid use for pain is highly controversial, findings emphasise a need for effective nonopioid alternatives.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40615331/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

Conducted across 214 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals, SNAP-3 enrolled 7134 surgical patients over 5 days in March 2022. The investigators identified frailty in one-fifth of patients using multiple tools, including the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Frailty was especially prevalent in emergency surgery and socioeconomically deprived populations. Multimorbidity was present in two-thirds of patients but only partially overlapped with frailty. Frailty was strongly associated with increased length of stay, delirium, complications, and mortality, with adverse outcomes escalating with higher CFS scores. In contrast, multimorbidity (without frailty) had limited association with most adverse outcomes. Directed acyclic graphs guided causal analysis, but by assuming frailty and multimorbidity were independent, the investigators might have underestimated the impact of multimorbidity. SNAP-3 highlights the need for routine perioperative frailty screening, comprehensive perioperative services, and workforce development. The data inform service planning and support prioritisation of frailty-focused care, especially in high-burden specialties and deprived areas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40562634/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

40541484,British journal of anaesthesia,Sustainability assessment of perioperative patient warming devices: a comparative life cycle assessment and costing.,Rebello TA; Spoyalo K; Chhipi-Shrestha G; Hewage K; Sadiq R; MacNeill AJ,"BACKGROUND: Perioperative patient warming is an integral component of quality surgical care, subject to highly variable clinical practices. We evaluated the environmental and economic impacts of currently available patient warming methods. METHODS: We conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) of three active warming devices (forced air warmer, resistive blanket, and circulating water garment) using a functional unit of 1 h of active patient warming. Passive warming was investigated using a singular LCA and LCC of warmed flannel blankets, with the functional unit defined as the use of one warmed flannel blanket. These results were applied to eight clinical scenarios modelling different combinations of warming devices within perioperative settings. We used multicriteria decision analysis to aggregate environmental and financial impacts into sustainability indexes. RESULTS: The resistive blanket had the lowest environmental and economic impacts. The global warming potential and cumulative energy demand of the resistive blanket were <7% and 25%, respectively, of the impacts assessed for the forced air warmer. The most sustainable patient warming pathway used the resistive blanket throughout the perioperative period. Clinical scenarios using flannel blankets before and after surgery entailed the highest environmental impacts, and the highest cost was incurred with the circulating water garment. CONCLUSIONS: The environmental and economic sustainability of perioperative patient warming can be optimised by minimising flannel blankets and disposable consumables in the perioperative period and by using the resistive blanket for active warming. This study presents a novel multicriteria sustainability index and simulates clinically relevant scenarios to inform practical, evidence-based recommendations for sustainable patient warming.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40541484/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

However, the mechanisms underlying spontaneous pain remain largely unknown in comparison to evoked pain (e.g. allodynia and hyperalgesia). Cortical processing is vital in coding nociception, and dysfunction of anterior cingulate cortex might facilitate pain hypersensitivity. This indicates a distinct pattern of ensemble activity during spontaneous pain-like behaviour. METHODS: Combining in vivo calcium imaging and ex vivo electrophysiological recording, we explored the maladaptive changes of cortical neurones at individual and population levels induced by several models of neuropathic pain in mice. We also examined the role of the anterior cingulate cortex in the regulation of spontaneous pain-like behaviour using optogenetic methods. RESULTS: We identified a common status of cortical hyperactivity in pyramidal neurones and neural ensembles recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex. Optogenetic inhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex inhibited spontaneous pain-like behaviour, while optogenetic activation restored it. In addition, the cortical representation of spontaneous behaviour was inhibited by nerve injury, which conversely was restored with pain relief. In freely moving animals, we further demonstrated a stable mode of cortical integration in response to spontaneous grooming episodes, independent of the presence of pain, with a dynamic reconfiguration mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal an essential role of the anterior cingulate cortex in the processing and modulation of non-evoked reflex in distinct preclinical models of neuropathic pain in mice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40533323/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

Significant efforts have been made to develop central and peripheral techniques that are both practicable and reliable, with increasing success and very low complication rates driving a growing appreciation for this subspecialty. Regional anesthesia can be used to optimize perioperative pain control, to avoid mechanical ventilation, and to take advantage of favorable immunomodulatory and gastrointestinal side effects in children. Implementing a broad spectrum of these techniques will require specialized knowledge of anatomic structures, experience to select appropriate techniques for specific surgical procedures, and considerable hand skills to execute these techniques. This review has been written to summarize state-of-the-art information about all relevant aspects of pediatric regional anesthesia and to provide a practical approach to how regional anesthesia in children can be implemented in daily clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40526440/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

METHODS: We identified children 1-18 yr of age who had a preoperative haematocrit recorded between 2012 and 2023 in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program paediatric databases. Patients were included in four groups: patients without anaemia who did not receive a transfusion, patients without anaemia who did receive a transfusion, patients with anaemia who did not receive a transfusion, and patients with anaemia who did receive a transfusion. The outcomes were 30-day mortality and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The incidence of preoperative anaemia was 25.7% (n=110 341), and the overall transfusion rate was 10.4% (n=44 808). Between 2012 and 2023, the incidences of preoperative anaemia and transfusion remained stable. The incidence of 30-day mortality increased significantly between children without anaemia who did not receive a transfusion (0.08%), without anaemia who did receive a transfusion (0.30%), with anaemia who did not receive a transfusion (0.27%), or with anaemia who did receive a transfusion (1.11%). The highest incidence of complications was found in children with anaemia exposed to perioperative transfusion.

The authors' institution underwent a prolonged EHR system outage that caused the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology to rely on established downtime procedures. While the intraoperative EHR is lost, this is only one of many domains that can be affected by an outage. In fact, all aspects of care, from patient identification materials to operating room schedules to in-house communication, can be significantly affected. Anesthesia providers must be ready to revert to preestablished downtime protocols to continue safe care while also maintaining financial sustainability.

However, the optimal single-shot regional anaesthesia modality remains unclear. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to May 5, 2024. Randomised controlled trials comparing various single-shot regional anaesthesia modalities were included. Frequentist and component network meta-analyses were performed. The primary outcomes included static and dynamic pain (visual analogue scale [VAS]) at 6 and 12 h after operation and total morphine consumption at 24 h. Additional outcomes included opioid-related adverse effects, patient satisfaction, quality of recovery, and postoperative lower limb muscle power. RESULTS: Eighty-seven randomised controlled trials were included. In static VAS, femoral nerve block ranked best (surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA)=92.8%), followed by lumbar plexus block (LPB) plus local infiltrative analgesia (LIA) (SUCRA=85.7%) at 6 h after operation. At 12 h after operation, LPB plus LIA was top ranked (SUCRA=89.2%), followed by quadratus lumborum block plus fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) (SUCRA=84.8%). In dynamic VAS, pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block plus LIA (SUCRA=86.3%) and LPB plus LIA (SUCRA=83.4%) ranked best at 6 and 12 h after operation, respectively. In total morphine consumption at 24 h after operation, quadratus lumborum block plus FICB ranked highest (SUCRA=85.5%), followed by LPB plus LIA (SUCRA=82.2%) and PENG plus LIA (SUCRA=76.5%). LPB, FICB, and femoral nerve block were associated with increased motor blockade affecting quadriceps or adductor muscles based on qualitative analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Combined regional anaesthesia modalities, particularly PENG plus LIA, are favourable options for primary total hip arthroplasty procedures, as they result in lower pain scores, reduced opioid consumption, and motor-sparing effects in the early postoperative period.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which general anaesthetics contribute to PND remain largely unknown. Based on our findings of a link between hyperhomocysteinaemia and increased risk of PND, we investigated functional alterations in cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and its role in memory function after general anaesthesia. METHODS: Mice were subjected to isoflurane 1.4 vol% anaesthesia for 2 h, and the levels of homocysteine, homocysteine-associated enzyme expression, and CBS activity were measured using ELISA. The time course of memory reconstruction after general anaesthesia was evaluated using the contextual fear conditioning test. WaterLOGSY was used to examine the interaction between isoflurane and CBS. A hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) probe, AZ-NO(2), was used for H(2)S bioimaging, and RNA sequencing, sulfhydrome detection, and in vivo electrophysiological recordings were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: The decline in cognitive function persisted for at least 8 h after isoflurane anaesthesia, which is attributed to the selective homocysteine accumulation in the brain via direct inhibition of CBS activity by isoflurane. Activation of CBS alleviates the reduction of H(2)S and alters the sulfhydration of synaptic-related proteins, ultimately accelerating the restoration of neuronal firing rates in the hippocampus (saline, 1.42 [0.49] vs NaHS, 2.45 [0.68] Hz). Pretreatment with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM, CBS activator) could increase the freezing time of mice after isoflurane anaesthesia (control 4.86 [3.30]% vs SAM, 9.89 [3.03]%). CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane contributes to delayed cognitive recovery after isoflurane anaesthesia in mice by directly inhibiting CBS activity, providing novel insights into the involvement of isoflurane in PNDs and their underlying mechanisms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40483182/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in resources of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov and multivariable meta-regression analyses of RCTs to identify trial-level characteristics associated with prevention effectiveness in pNCD/dNCR research. Trials investigating pNCD/dNCR prevention in adult surgical patients were eligible. Trials performed in paediatric patients or assessing cognitive changes on the same day of surgery were excluded. Effectiveness associated with trial-level characteristics was assessed using ratio of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We analysed 187 eligible trials. Trials originating from the USA/Canada (ratio of OR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.62-5.73; P=0.001), Europe/Australia/New Zealand (1.58; 1.04-2.40; P=0.033), and other regions (2.0; 1.19-3.36; P=0.009) were associated with reduced effectiveness compared with trials from China. Higher pNCD/dNCR incidence in control groups was associated with greater effectiveness (0.98; 0.97-0.99; P<0.001). Trials involving volatile anaesthetics (2.12; 1.16-3.86; P=0.014) were associated with reduced effectiveness compared with dexmedetomidine and abdominal surgery, respectively. Registered trials exhibited enhanced effectiveness (0.69; 0.50-0.95; P=0.022), whereas those with power analyses reported reduced effectiveness (1.43; 1.06-1.94; P=0.021). Trials with a high risk of bias in the selection of the reported result were associated with reduced effectiveness (2.99; 1.04-8.59; P=0.041). Dexmedetomidine was the most studied intervention, showing potential benefits, though evidence certainty was very low. CONCLUSIONS: Trial-level characteristics were significantly associated with prevention effectiveness in pNCD/dNCR research. Identifying and addressing the underlying causes of regional differences might enhance the quality and consistency of future trials on a global level.

Over the last two decades, a plethora of new agents have emerged to help treat the condition, of which several classes of agent have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, there have been several developments in the pharmacology of insulin, improving the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin analogues to better mimic physiological insulin concentrations in the liver, skeletal muscle, and other tissues. Furthermore, the technologies used to deliver insulin and measure glucose have improved; for example, in the UK, hybrid closed loop systems are now the standard of care for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This review focuses on insulin and insulin delivery. We consider the history of insulin development and the pharmacology of newer insulin analogues.

Ultrasound-guided pericapsular nerve group (PENG) neurolysis using ethanol is a minimally invasive technique that may provide extended analgesia. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided 95% ethanol neurolysis of the PENG compared with a sham procedure in patients with chronic hip pain. METHODS: This double-blinded, single-centre, RCT included 100 patients (median age: 82 yr [IQR 74-89]; 49% male) with chronic hip pain unresponsive to conservative treatments. Participants were assigned to either ethanol neurolysis (n=50) or a sham procedure (n=50). The primary outcome was pain intensity (numeric rating scale [NRS]) assessed at 7 days, 30 days, 3 months, and 6 months. Secondary outcomes included opioid consumption (oral morphine equivalents), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), and neurological deficits. RESULTS: Ethanol neurolysis significantly reduced NRS scores at all follow-ups (P<0.0001). The mean NRS scores decreased from baseline 6.0 (sd 0.9) to 3.1 (0.8) at 7 days, 2.9 (0.7) at 30 days, 2.8 (0.7) at 3 months, and 3.0 (0.7) at 6 months. Opioid consumption was lower in the neurolysis group at 7 days (median [IQR]: 1.5 [0.5-3.5] mg vs 11.5 [9.1-13.7] mg, P=0.002) and remained reduced through 6 months. Quality of life improved significantly (P<0.0001), and no neurological deficits were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided ethanol neurolysis of the PENG is a safe and effective intervention for chronic hip pain, providing long-term relief and reducing opioid dependency. Further multicentre trials are needed to validate long-term outcomes. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT06087588.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40480912/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

The present study aims to describe the characteristics of MDT meetings and their effect on 30-day patient outcomes. METHODS: A prospective, multicentre, observational study was conducted in nine hospitals in the Netherlands. From each hospital, 25 consecutive adult high-risk noncardiac surgical patients discussed in a preoperative MDT meeting were included. Data were collected between April 2022 and September 2023, including patient and MDT characteristics, clinical information, and patient outcomes up to 30 days after surgery. RESULTS: The present study included 225 patients, with a median age of 73 yr (interquartile range 64-79 yr). Patients were selected for an MDT discussion because of doubt regarding the harm-benefit ratio of the proposed surgery (n=168; 75%) or as part of a standardised surgical pathway (n=57; 25%). Clinical management was modified after MDT discussions for 183 (81%) patients, including 71 patients (32%) who underwent nonsurgical management after MDT discussion. Within 30 days after surgery, 75 patients (49%) experienced adverse events, compared with 16 patients (23%) after nonsurgical management. The 30-day mortality rate was 3% after surgery and 11% after nonsurgical management. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative MDT discussions lead to management modifications for high-risk noncardiac surgical patients. Almost one-third of the discussed patients did not undergo surgery. The rate of postoperative adverse events was high in this selected population. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of MDT decisions on the quality of life and disability experienced by these patients.

METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, positive-controlled, noninferiority phase III clinical trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of adamagammadex compared with sugammadex in reversing deep rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. In total, 321 patients were randomly assigned to either the adamgammadex 8 mg kg(-1) group or the sugammadex 4 mg kg(-1) group. The primary outcome was the success rate of antagonism, defined as recovery of the train-of-four ratio (TOFR) to 0.9 within 10 min. Standard safety data were collected throughout the trial period. RESULTS: For the primary efficacy outcome, the success rate for recovery of TOFR to 0.9 was 98.7% in the adamgammadex group and 100% in the sugammadex group, with an observed difference of -1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] -4.6%, 1.2%). The lower limit of -4.6% was higher than the noninferiority margin of -10%. For the key secondary efficacy outcomes, the median (interquartile range) time from administration of adamgammadex or sugammadex to recovery of TOFR to 0.9 was 2.5 (2.0, 3.2) min and 2.2 (1.7, 2.7) min, respectively. The difference was 0.5 min (95% CI 0.3, 0.7), and the upper limit of 0.7 min was lower than the noninferiority margin of 5 min. We observed no inferiority in secondary efficacy outcomes. There was no significant difference in the safety profile between adamgammadex and sugammadex.

Identifying biomarkers can optimise prophylactic strategies. This study investigated whether plasma growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) concentrations were associated with PONV in at-risk adult patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: Patients (n = 896) from a previous randomised controlled trial were included. Blood samples were collected before surgery in the pre-anaesthesia room and at the end of surgery. Plasma GDF-15 concentrations were measured using the Human GDF-15 ELISA Kit. The primary outcome was PONV, defined as nausea, retching, or vomiting, within 120 h after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 860 (96.0%) of patients were female. During 0-120 h after surgery, 531 (59.3%) patients experienced PONV. Unadjusted logistic models showed negative associations between preoperative and postoperative GDF-15 concentrations and PONV, but this association was not significant for postoperative concentrations after adjustment for confounders including preoperative concentrations. Compared with the first tertile of preoperative GDF-15 concentrations, the second tertile had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44-0.91; P=0.013), and the third tertile had an aOR of 0.44 (95% CI 0.30-0.64; P<0.001) for PONV. Restricted cubic splines showed that PONV odds decreased rapidly until the preoperative GDF-15 concentrations were 830.36 pg ml(-1) and then plateaued (P for overall <0.001, P for non-linearity=0.002). Compared with a low-maintaining trajectory, a high-increasing trajectory had an aOR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.46-0.89; P=0.008) for PONV. CONCLUSIONS: Lower preoperative plasma GDF-15 concentrations or low-maintaining trajectory were associated with higher odds of PONV in laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40441987/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

METHODS: We investigated this disparity from a genetic perspective using data from the UK Biobank, focusing on multisite chronic pain, which is highly heritable and manifests a sex bias. RESULTS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that women have approximately 4500 sex-specific causal loci for overlapping pains, four times more than men, accounting for their higher heritability. Heritability partitioning indicated that pain-related loci are primarily enriched in specific brain regions, but only in women. Additionally, 200 imaging-derived brain phenotypes were significantly associated with pain in women, compared with only six in men. GWAS of these brain phenotypes showed stronger genetic correlations with pain in women, particularly regarding cortical thickness and striatal volume. When disentangling pleiotropy from causation in genetically correlated pairs of brain- and pain-related traits, we found that the genetics of brain phenotypes are more often causally implicated with the presence of chronic pain in women. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetics play a crucial role in the increased risk of chronic pain observed in women.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40410097/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

However, the influence of preoperative iron deficiency without anaemia on postoperative outcomes after hip and knee arthroplasty is uncertain. METHODS: We used the Fast-track Center for Hip and Knee Replacement Database registry from eight Danish departments for this prospective cohort study. Anaemia and iron deficiency were defined as haemoglobin of <130 g L(-1) and transferrin saturation <20%, respectively. Patient characteristics were collected using patient-reported questionnaires and information on prescribed medication, laboratory results and follow-up using electronic healthcare records. Quantile regression was used to analyse changes in median days alive and at home at postoperative day 30 (DAH(30)) and day 90 (DAH(90)), adjusting for procedure, hospital, and comorbidity. Additional endpoints included length of hospital stay >2 days, 30-day readmission rate, and self-evaluated health (EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale [EQ-VAS]) at 90 days. RESULTS: The cohort included 964 iron deficient and 3919 iron replete participants undergoing primary unilateral hip or knee arthroplasty. Median DAH(30) was 29.0 (interquartile range 29.0-30.0) days in both groups, but differently distributed (P<0.001). Adjusted difference in median DAH was -0.00 (95% confidence interval -0.00 to -0.00; P=0.001) and -0.00 (95% confidence interval -0.00 to -0.00; P=0.006) days for DAH(30) and DAH(90), respectively. There was no association between iron deficiency and any of the other endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of iron deficiency on days alive and at home at 30 and 90 days after fast-track hip or knee arthroplasty was statistically significant, but of minimal clinical importance. Correction of preoperative iron deficiency without anaemia is unlikely to improve common postoperative outcomes in these procedures.

Our previous findings revealed that the interactions between spinal microglia and astrocytes are crucial for burn-induced pain hypersensitivity. However, the mechanisms underlying burn-induced peripheral sensitisation remain incompletely understood. METHODS: Sensory neurone-satellite glial cell (SGC) interactions within peripheral dorsal root ganglia were investigated using in vitro and in vivo experiments. Behavioural tests were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting peripheral sensitisation mechanisms for burn pain management. RESULTS: Burn injury upregulated calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression in sensory neurones (1.5-fold; P=0.013) through transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels. Pharmacological blockade of the TRPV1/CGRP signalling pathway effectively attenuated burn-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Additionally, neurone-derived CGRP triggered SGC activation (from 6.8% pre-injury to 41.6% at day 5 post-injury), concomitant with enhanced gap junction-mediated SGC coupling (from 16.7% pre-injury to 40.5% at day 5 post-injury). Furthermore, chemokine expression (particularly CXCL1) in SGCs was elevated after burn injury, which potentiated sensory neurone excitability and exacerbated pain hypersensitivity. Blocking SGC coupling exerted potent analgesic effects in this burn pain model. CONCLUSIONS: A novel neurone-SGC interaction mechanism drives burn-induced peripheral sensitisation, providing translational implications for burn pain therapeutics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40404497/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

There is an urgent need to identify predictors of POD to prevent its onset, as it can significantly delay recovery from surgery. Benzodiazepines are among the most frequently prescribed medications, particularly for female individuals. They have a depressant effect on the central nervous system and are used to treat sleep disorders, anxiety, muscle relaxation and epilepsy. However, benzodiazepines may increase the risk of POD. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether long-term benzodiazepine use, premedication and the interaction of benzodiazepines with sex are associated with the occurrence of POD and postoperative neurocognitive ability. DESIGN: A part analysis of the prospective multicentre BioCog cohort study. SETTING: Two-centre study conducted at Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin (Germany) and University Hospital Utrecht (Netherlands), both primary care hospitals, between October 2014 and September 2019. PATIENTS: Data from 928 patients from the BioCog cohort study who underwent elective surgery were analysed. Of these, 42.3% were women, 18.6% reported long-term benzodiazepine use and 12.4% received premedication with benzodiazepines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We studied the association of benzodiazepine use on cognition and the development of POD. We found that the timing of benzodiazepine use was crucial. RESULTS: Long-term benzodiazepine use was significantly associated with the risk of developing POD, independent of sex ( P  < 0.001). In contrast, premedication with benzodiazepines immediately before surgery was not associated with the risk of POD ( P  = 0.242). males and females developed POD at similar rates. Regardless of sex, long-term benzodiazepine use elevated the risk of POD, unlike premedication with benzodiazepines. CONCLUSION: Long-term use of benzodiazepines is associated with the development of POD, but short-term use as a premedicant is not. However, as this is an observational study, further research is needed to confirm these findings in a controlled setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02265263).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40384317/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

OBJECTIVES: To compare postoperative pain and recovery after laparoscopic bariatric surgery with a total opioid-free care pathway and conventional opioid-based treatment. DESIGN: A multicentre nonblinded controlled trial. SETTING: Two university hospitals in Sweden. PATIENTS: Adult patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were enrolled between May 2019 and November 2023. Of 837 patients screened, 112 were randomised, and 110 were included in the analysis: 55 in the intervention and 55 in the control group. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to an opioid-based standard care (control group) or to an opioid-free care pathway (intervention group), including intraoperative OFA and postoperative first-line transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in patient-reported postoperative pain intensity on a numerical rating scale (NRS) from arrival in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) until discharge to the surgical ward. Key secondary outcomes were postoperative pain intensity, in-hospital opioid consumption, and postoperative quality of recovery scale (PQRS) scores. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups regarding the changes in pain intensity from arrival in PACU until discharge to the ward, with mean +/- SD changes in NRS of 3.20 +/- 3.01 (intervention) vs. 3.15 +/- 2.25 (control); mean difference (MD) 0.04 [(95% confidence interval (CI), -1.00 to 1.08); P  = 0.97], and pain intensity at 24 h ( P  = 0.078), 72 h ( P  = 0.060), and 3 months ( P  = 0.30) postoperatively. The intervention group had a significantly lower opioid consumption in the PACU; mean morphine equivalents 6.08 +/- 12.31 vs. 51.1 +/- 14.9 mg; MD -45.0 (95% CI, -50.1 to -39.8) mg; P  < 0.0001; and during the hospital stay MD -40.3 (95% CI, -54.4 to -25.9) mg; P  < 0.0001. Total PQRS scores did not differ significantly over the 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: The opioid-free care pathway offers patients pain relief and recovery outcomes comparable to conventional opioid-based care and reduces opioid use after laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

40355106,Anesthesiology,Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Remimazolam for Procedural Sedation in Children and Adolescents.,Colin PJ; Bichajian LH; Curt VR; Koomen JV; Stohr T; Struys MMRF; Mason KP,"BACKGROUND: Remimazolam is not approved for use in pediatric patients. The pharmacokinetics of remimazolam have been reported to be similar to those of adult patients after scaling for body size. This article reports on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 yr and a subsequent model-based optimization of the used dosing regimen. METHODS: Thirty-one patients were included in the trial and stratified across four treatment arms: bolus administration, infusion, bolus plus fentanyl, or infusion plus fentanyl. The University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan) Sedation Scale (UMSS) was used to assess the depth of sedation. Blood samples were drawn to measure the concentrations of remimazolam and its metabolite CNS7054. Population pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling was performed in NONMEM (GloboMax LLC, USA). RESULTS: A population pharmacokinetic model was developed for remimazolam and CNS7054. The elimination clearance of remimazolam was 0.70 l . min -1 . 70 kg -1 . A proportional odds model combined with a simplified Minto model described the observed UMSS well. The EC50 of remimazolam for a UMSS score of 3 or greater was 777 ng . ml -1 in the absence of fentanyl, and decreased to 655, 533, and 287 ng/ml for concomitant fentanyl steady state concentrations of 1, 2, or 4 ng . ml -1 , respectively. Simulations confirmed that the studied dosing regimen resulted in 9.2 to 22.0% of patients not reaching a UMSS score of 3 or greater at the end of the induction. Model-based optimization resulted in higher per-kilogram dosages and the removal of the maximum allowable dose. Simulations indicated that the percentage of patients achieving a UMSS score of 3 or greater can be expected to be high (88 to 97%). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the pharmacokinetics of remimazolam are likely different between children 6 yr or older and adults (after correcting for size). In addition, the exposure-response relationship shows that to effectively use remimazolam for procedural sedation in children 6 yr or older, the dosing regimen should be modified to allow for higher remimazolam exposures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40355106/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

Conversely, tracheal extubation in the post-anaesthesia care unit may prolong the duration of anaesthesia and increase the incidence of complications. Our primary objective was to quantify the additional occupancy time associated with tracheal extubation in the operating theatre compared with the post-anaesthesia care unit. Secondary objectives were to assess the incidence of complications after tracheal extubation, including the need for ventilatory support. METHODS: This was a prospective dual-centre observational cohort study of patients whose tracheas were intubated for surgery in the operating theatre of two university hospitals. The primary endpoint was operating theatre occupancy time between the end of surgical procedure and discharge from the operating theatre. RESULTS: In total, 756 patients were included, and 494 (65.3%) tracheal extubations occurred in the operating theatre. Room occupancy time was increased by 7 min (95%CI 5-8 min, p = 0.001) when tracheal extubation was performed in the operating theatre compared with the post-anaesthesia care unit. After adjustment by matched or weighted propensity score, this time increased to 8 min (95%CI 6-10 min, p = 0.001) and 8 min (95%CI 6-9 min, p = 0.001), respectively. Desaturation after tracheal extubation (20.9% vs. 36.3%, p < 0.001) and arterial hypotension (0.6% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.019) were less frequent when tracheal extubation took place in the operating theatre. DISCUSSION: Tracheal extubation in the operating theatre is associated with an increase in theatre occupancy of < 8 min and a lower incidence of postoperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40351134/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

40333028,Anesthesiology,General Anesthesia-activated Neurons in the Central Amygdala Mediate Antinociception: Distinct Roles in Acute versus Chronic Phases of Nerve Injury.,Zhao J; Furutani K; McGinnis A; Mathew JP; Wang F; Ji RR,"BACKGROUND: General anesthesia, such as isoflurane, induces analgesia (loss of pain) and loss of consciousness through mechanisms that are not fully understood. A distinct population of gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurons has been recently identified in the central amygdala (CeA) that can be activated by general anesthesia (CeA GA ) and exert antinociceptive functions. In this study, the authors aimed to explore the underlying cellular mechanisms of CeA GA neurons across different phases of nerve injury-induced nociceptive sensitization in mice. METHODS: This study used 107 mice, including 57 males and 50 females. The authors induced c-fos activation in the mice brains using 1.2% isoflurane and validated Fos expression via RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, USA) in situ hybridization. Unlike previous studies using the capturing activated neuronal ensembles method, CeA GA neurons (tdTomato + ) were labeled using the Fos-Targeted Recombination in Active Populations (TRAP2) method. The authors then performed ex vivo electrophysiologic recordings to assess the properties of both Fos-positive/CeA GA neurons and Fos-negative CeA neurons. Using chemogenetic strategy to selectively activate the CeA GA neurons, the authors investigated pain-like behaviors and associated comorbidities in mice after spared nerve injury (SNI). RESULTS: Isoflurane induced robust Fos expression in CeA gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurons. Electrophysiologic recordings in brain slices revealed that compared to Fos-negative CeA neurons, CeA GA neurons had higher excitability and exhibited distinct patterns of action potentials. Chemogenetic activation of Fos-TRAPed CeA GA neurons increased nociceptive thresholds in naive mice and in mice 2 weeks after SNI, but demonstrated modest antinociception 8 weeks after SNI. Finally, Fos-negative CeA neurons, but not CeA GA neurons, exhibited increased excitability in the chronic phase of SNI, which was correlated with a downregulation of K + -Cl - cotransporter-2 (KCC2) in the CeA (sham vs . SNI 8 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: These results validate the antinociceptive power of CeA GA neurons using a different approach. Additionally, the authors highlight distinct roles of CeA GA neurons in governing physiologic pain, acute pain, and the transition to chronic pain through KCC2 dysregulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40333028/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08
40327558,Anesthesia and analgesia,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Sugammadex versus Neostigmine for Reversal of Rocuronium on Gastric Emptying in Adults Undergoing Elective Colorectal Surgery.,Togioka BM; Rakshe SK; Ye S; Tekkali P; Tsikitis VL; Fang SH; Herzig DO; Lu KC; Aziz MF,"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal function is mediated by the cholinergic pathway, which is impacted by neostigmine and glycopyrrolate, but not sugammadex. We hypothesized that sugammadex is associated with earlier gastric emptying in adults undergoing colorectal surgery, compared to neostigmine-glycopyrrolate. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in a pragmatic, single-center, patient and assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. At skin closure, subjects were randomized to sugammadex 2 mg/kg or neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg per 1 mg of neostigmine). The primary end point, gastric emptying, was assessed with the paracetamol absorption test, with greater area under the curve representing faster gastric emptying. Secondary end points included time to first bowel movement, time to achieve adequate reversal (train-of-four ratio >/=0.9), gastrointestinal complications, hospital length of stay, and postanesthesia care unit recovery time. The analysis was intention-to-treat. RESULTS: All 60 patients randomized to sugammadex received the allocated intervention. Of 60 patients randomized to neostigmine-glycopyrrolate, 56 received neostigmine-glycopyrrolate, 2 received sugammadex, and 2 received both agents. Gastric emptying did not differ significantly between sugammadex (mean [standard deviation SD] area under the curve AUC 1118 [122]) and neostigmine (AUC 1130 [117], P = .58). Sugammadex treatment was associated with shorter time to first bowel movement (44.3 hours [33.8] vs 61.0 hours [43.0]; difference = 16.7 hours, 95% confidence interval CI, [2.3-31.1], P = .02) and time to adequate reversal (5.2 minutes [6.3] vs 17.5 minutes [10.1]; difference = 12.3 minutes, 95% CI, [9.2-15.4], P < .001). Neostigmine-glycopyrrolate treatment was not associated with a significant increase in gastrointestinal complications (32% vs 17%; OR = 2.3, 95% CI, [0.9-6.2], P = .09), a longer hospital length of stay (7.8 days [19.8] vs 4.8 days [4.9]; difference = 3 days, 95% CI, [ - 2.2 to 8.3], P = .27), or a difference in postanesthesia care unit recovery time (108 minutes [56.4] vs 115 minutes [50.3]; difference= -6.9 minutes, 95% CI, [ - 26.4 to 12.6], P = .48). Adverse events were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Sugammadex treatment was not associated with faster gastric emptying (primary end point). Regarding prespecified secondary end points, sugammadex treatment was associated with a 12.3-minute shorter time to adequate reversal in real-life practice conditions, but it did not benefit the proportion of subjects with a gastrointestinal complication, hospital length of stay, or postanesthesia care unit recovery time. Further studies are needed to confirm our finding that sugammadex is associated with a clinically significant 16.7-hour shorter time to first bowel movement, and to establish the role of sugammadex in colorectal surgery enhanced recovery protocols.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40327558/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

There is little information on its use in younger children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sugammadex in children under 2 yr of age. METHODS: This was a phase IV, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial of sugammadex in participants aged birth to less than 2 yr (NCT03909165). Part A was open label and included pharmacokinetic assessments to determine whether sugammadex dose adjustment for part B was necessary based on age. Part B was double-blind and evaluated doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg sugammadex. Participants were randomized to (1) moderate NMB and reversal with 2 mg/kg sugammadex; (2) moderate NMB and reversal with neostigmine + glycopyrrolate or atropine (hereafter, called neostigmine); or (3) deep NMB and reversal with 4 mg/kg sugammadex. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to neuromuscular recovery (TTNMR). The primary efficacy hypothesis was that 2 mg/kg sugammadex would be superior to neostigmine for the reversal of moderate NMB as measured by TTNMR in part B. RESULTS: A total of 138 participants aged 1 to 720 days were treated in parts A and B (2 mg/kg sugammadex, n = 44; 4 mg/kg sugammadex, n = 63; and neostigmine, n = 31). Based on pharmacokinetic assessments in part A, no dose adjustments for age were needed. In part B, TTNMR for reversal of moderate NMB was faster with 2 mg/kg sugammadex than neostigmine (median of 1.4 min vs. 4.4 min; hazard ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.37 to 4.18; P = 0.0002). A 4-mg/kg dose of sugammadex achieved rapid TTNMR for reversal of deep NMB with a median of 1.1 min (parts A and B). The percentage of participants with one or more adverse events (parts A and B) was similar for sugammadex and neostigmine. No deaths, drug-related serious adverse events, or hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In children less than 2 yr old, 2 mg/kg sugammadex reversed moderate NMB faster than neostigmine, and 4 mg/kg sugammadex rapidly reversed deep NMB. Sugammadex doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg were well tolerated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40324166/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

Previous reviews provided low-grade evidence that honey may improve recovery. The BEE PAIN FREE study investigated whether honey alongside multimodal analgesia improved the recovery trajectory in children following tonsillectomy. METHODS: A prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted across three centres in Western Australia. Children undergoing extracapsular tonsillectomy by coblation were allocated randomly to one of four postoperative treatment groups: standard treatment alone; Marri honey (from Western Australia); Manuka honey (from Western Australia); or placebo. The intervention groups took 5 ml of honey or placebo, six times a day, for at least 7 days, in addition to usual discharge analgesia (standard treatment). Data for daily pain scores, Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure scores, medications and unplanned re-presentations were collected. RESULTS: A total of 400 children were recruited; 20% were lost to follow-up or withdrew. The mean number of honey doses taken varied between 2 and 3 doses per day over 7 days. Treatment with honey at this frequency did not impact postoperative pain scores significantly, with all groups showing similar trajectories. These findings did not alter with as-treated analysis or using imputed models for missing data. Most children experienced significant pain until around postoperative day 8. Children allocated to the honey and placebo groups showed some improved oral tolerance around day 6 but had increased vomiting during earlier days. There were no clinically significant differences in medical re-presentations, simple analgesia or oxycodone usage between groups. DISCUSSION: Two to three doses daily of oral honey/placebo in children post-extracapsular tonsillectomy for 7 days, in addition to regular paracetamol, ibuprofen and as required oxycodone did not result in a clinical improvement in pain or recovery over a 14-day follow-up period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40321015/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

OBJECTIVES: Assessment of predictive performance of the EEOT in the intensive care unit (ICU) and operating room. DESIGN: Systematic review of observational diagnostic test accuracy studies with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus were used as data sources for relevant publications until February 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Prospective clinical studies in which the EEOT was used to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated adults, regardless of the clinical care context. The operative performance characteristics must also have been reported. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies involving 1073 adult patients (588 receiving intensive care and 485 in the operating room) were systematically reviewed, and 22 studies comprising 1049 volume expansions were meta-analysed. The pooled sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI)] of the EEOT was 0.87 (0.81 to 0.92), and the pooled specificity was 0.90 (0.85 to 0.94); the median [interquartile range] cardiac index ( CI ) threshold for a positive test was a 5.0 [3.3 to 5.3] increase. The clinical context, the method used for haemodynamic monitoring, the ratio of the averaging time of the monitoring method to the occlusion time, the levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and the choice of cardiac output marker were identified as significant sources of heterogeneity. However, the occlusion duration and tidal volume did not significantly affect its performance. A novel insight is that performance was notably lower in the operating room setting. The likelihood ratios were 14 (positive) and 0.12 (negative) for the ICU, both better than 3.1 and 0.21 for the operating room. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed to be very low, mainly due to high heterogeneity and risk of bias; however, no publication bias was detected. CONCLUSION: The EEOT for predicting fluid responsiveness in critical care performs acceptably well overall and is a confirmative test. In the operating room and/or with specific technical settings, its performance and clinical utility are reduced, driving the need for more context-specific and patient-specific fluid responsiveness assessments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40260456/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08
40258137,Anesthesiology,Breath Analysis of Propofol and Associated Metabolic Signatures: A Pilot Study Using Secondary Electrospray Ionization-High-resolution Mass Spectrometry.,Zeng J; Stankovic N; Singh KD; Steiner R; Frey U; Erb T; Sinues P,"BACKGROUND: Propofol is a widely used anesthetic for total IV anesthesia. Although it is generally safe, rare but serious complications can occur in vulnerable groups, such as critically ill patients and children. Clinicians often rely on surrogate measures ( e.g. , predicted effect-site concentrations or Bispectral Index), yet more direct indicators of anesthetic exposure and metabolic stress would be valuable. The authors hypothesized that pharmacometabolomics via breath analysis could yield real-time insights into propofol concentrations as well as accompanying metabolic responses to surgery. METHODS: In this pilot study, 10 pediatric patients (median age, 5.9 yr; interquartile range, 4.3 to 6.6) undergoing propofol anesthesia contributed 47 breath samples (10 preinduction, 37 postinduction) and 37 blood samples. All samples were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Linear mixed-effects models examined associations between exhaled compounds and serum propofol concentrations while accounting for repeated measures in individual patients. Volcano plots were used to identify differential changes in metabolites after propofol induction. RESULTS: Propofol, its metabolites, and endogenous metabolites were readily detected in exhaled breath, demonstrating strong correlations with serum propofol concentrations (partial R (2) >/= 0.65; adjusted P < 0.001). Differential analysis showed significant upregulation of endogenous fatty aldehydes (log 2 [postinduction/preinduction] >/= 1; adjusted P </= 0.05), suggestive of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. Exogenous compounds, including benzene and phenols, were also observed, reflecting propofol metabolism in vivo . CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study highlights a robust breath-serum relationship for propofol and reveals surgery-associated shifts in metabolic pathways, including evidence of oxidative stress. These findings underscore the feasibility of exhaled-breath pharmacometabolomics for individualized anesthetic care. Further validation in larger cohorts is warranted to confirm clinical utility and to determine whether real-time breath analysis could ultimately serve as a useful adjunct for guiding anesthetic management and monitoring perioperative metabolic responses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40258137/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

We hypothesized that neuromuscular blockade is associated with a higher risk of delirium after surgery, and that this can be mitigated by administration of reversal agents. METHODS: In total, 53,772 adult hospitalized patients aged >/=60 years who underwent general anesthesia for noncardiac, nonneurosurgical, nontransplant procedures between 2008 and 2024 at a tertiary health care network in Massachusetts, were included. The exposure was the intraoperative administration of ND-NMBAs. The primary outcome was 7-day delirium, identified from nursing and physician charts using a keyword-based search strategy paired with manual chart review, Confusion Assessment Method assessments, and International Classification of Diseases (9th/10th Revision, Clinical Modification) diagnostic codes. RESULTS: In total, 43,723 (81.3%) patients received neuromuscular blockade. Approximately 2259 (4.2%) patients developed delirium, 1884 (4.3%) with, and 375 (3.7%) without ND-NMBA administration. In adjusted analyses, administration of ND-NMBAs was dose-dependently associated with a higher risk of postoperative delirium (adjusted odds ratio [OR adj ] 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.31; P = .038 and 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.12; P < .001 per each unit increase in the effective dose required to achieve a 95% twitch reduction). 38,143 (87.2%) patients who received ND-NMBAs also received a reversal agent, which was associated with a lower risk of impaired neuromuscular recovery (preextubation train-of-four ratio <95; OR adj 0.60; 95% CI, 0.49-0.74; P < .001) and delirium (OR adj 0.73; 95% CI, 0.64-0.83; P < .001), compared to no reversal. The adverse effect of ND-NMBAs on delirium risk was eliminated by reversal agent administration (OR adj 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94-1.23; P = .30 with and OR adj 1.52; 95% CI, 1.28-1.79; P < .001 without reversal agent administration). There was no association between administration of neostigmine, compared to sugammadex, with postoperative delirium (OR adj 0.91; 95% CI, 0.73-1.12; P = .36). CONCLUSIONS: Neuromuscular blockade during general anesthesia is dose-dependently associated with a higher risk of postoperative delirium. The administration of reversal agents mitigates this risk and might help reduce the occurrence of delirium after surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40251137/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08
40237779,Anesthesiology,Obstetric Anesthesia Workforce Survey: Forty-year Update.,Bucklin BA; Hawkins JL; Asdigian NL; Kennerley V; Pattee J; Traynor AJ,"BACKGROUND: For 40 yr, Obstetric Anesthesia Workforce Surveys have been used every decade to assess trends in obstetric anesthesia practice and potential areas for improvement. Anesthesia providers from U.S. hospitals were surveyed in 2022 to 2023 to provide data for their hospitals from 2021. The primary hypothesis was that obstetric anesthesia services have changed in the last decade. METHODS: Previous workforce surveys were used to develop the 32-question survey about contemporary obstetric anesthesia practice. A hospital sample (n = 1,180) was generated based on number of births per year and U.S. census region. Using web-push survey methodology, a QR code was assigned to the ""Chief of Anesthesiology"" at each hospital. A link to an online Research Electron Data Capture survey was emailed to individuals along with reminder communications. Nonresponding hospitals received paper surveys and self-addressed stamped envelopes for survey return. The results were analyzed using R statistical package at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: There were 284 (24%) responses to the survey. Hospitals providing obstetric care have decreased 50% over four decades. Of all the respondents, 77% work in nonacademic hospitals without residency programs. Comparing academic to nonacademic hospitals, academic providers are less likely to have other clinical responsibilities: 35% versus 62%, respectively. The weighted overall rate of neuraxial labor analgesia is 84%. Elective cesarean deliveries are usually performed with spinal anesthesia (85%). Neuraxial anesthesia is used in 86% of urgent cesareans, while 14% use general anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite stable annual birth rates in the United States, the number of hospitals providing obstetric care decreased by 50% over the last 40 yr. This study describes nonacademic practice and not just academic teaching hospitals. Increased access to neuraxial labor analgesia is a dramatic step toward reducing in-hospital maternal mortality and improving healthcare disparities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40237779/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

This study aimed to test the performance of these models in the Chinese setting and to construct and externally validate a novel model. METHODS: A total of 21,855 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent congenital heart surgery from January 2015 to December 2021 in Shanghai Children's Medical Center were enrolled. For external validation, the study additionally pooled 5,221 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent this surgical treatment from January 2020 to December 2021 in Beijing Fuwai Hospital. The performance of the Aristotle Basis Complexity (ABC) score, Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS)-1 categories, Society of Thoracic Surgeons-European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (STAT) score, and STAT categories was tested. Independent predictors were used to develop a model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) and Brier score were used to examine the model performance. RESULTS: The AUROCs were 0.778 for ABC score, 0.685 for RACHS-1 categories, 0.808 for STAT score, and 0.784 for STAT categories. When preoperative covariates were added to the four models, the AUROCs improved: ABC score (AUROC = 0.860), RACHS-1 categories (AUROC = 0.844), STAT score (AUROC = 0.856), and STAT categories (AUROC = 0.864). The best-performing model incorporated six variables, including age, height, oxygen support, previous cardiac operation, emergency surgery, and STAT categories. The AUROCs and Brier score were 0.864 and 0.00977 in the development cohort and 0.860 and 0.00654 in the external validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The four major traditional models were only moderately effective in predicting in-hospital mortality after congenital heart surgery in the Chinese setting. The novel model founded on the STAT categories in combination with preoperative covariates can serve as a useful and effective tool for predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality after congenital heart surgery in the Chinese setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40237771/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

We aimed to determine whether there is an association between intrathecal morphine administration and pulmonary complications after non-obstetric surgery. We also aimed to determine whether there was a dose-dependent effect on pulmonary complications. METHODS: We searched the literature systematically for randomised controlled trials comparing intrathecal morphine vs. control in patients undergoing any type of non-obstetric surgery under general or spinal anaesthesia. Primary outcomes were rates of postoperative sedation, respiratory depression and hypoxaemia. We performed a meta-analysis and meta-regression for each of our outcomes of interest and conducted trial sequential analysis to assess whether the required information size was achieved. RESULTS: We included 127 trials (7388 patients). Rates of sedation and hypoxaemia were not increased significantly in patients receiving intrathecal morphine (odds ratio 1.00, 95%CI 0.78-1.28, p = 0.98, moderate quality evidence; and 1.22, 95%CI 0.84-1.79, p = 0.30, moderate quality evidence, respectively). There were more episodes of respiratory depression in patients receiving intrathecal morphine than control (odds ratio 1.78, 95%CI 1.19-2.67, p = 0.005, very low-quality evidence), which was no longer significant when morphine doses > 500 mug were not included (odds ratio1.49, 95%CI 0.99-2.23, p = 0.06). Meta-regression revealed associations between dose and rate of sedation, respiratory depression and hypoxaemia, but when doses of > 500 mug were not included, these associations did not persist. Trial sequential analyses suggest that further data may still be required for all outcomes, but statistical significance was reached for respiratory depression. DISCUSSION: There is moderate evidence that intrathecal morphine does not increase rates of sedation or hypoxaemia after non-obstetric surgery. There is very low-quality evidence that intrathecal morphine might increase the rate of respiratory depression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40235368/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

The associations between stable chronic heart failure and postoperative outcomes have not been explored extensively. The aim of this study was to determine associations between stable chronic heart failure and its peri-operative management and postoperative outcomes after major non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of MET-REPAIR, an international prospective cohort study including patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery aged >/= 45 y with increased cardiovascular risk. Main exposures were stable chronic heart failure and availability of a pre-operative transthoracic echocardiogram. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative major adverse cardiovascular events at 30 days. Secondary endpoints included 30-day mortality and severe in-hospital complications. Multivariable logistic regression models were calculated. RESULTS: Of 15,158 included patients, 3880 (25.6%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for stable chronic heart failure, of whom 1397 (36%) were female. Chronic heart failure was associated with increased risk of postoperative 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 2.04, 95%CI 1.59-2.60), 30-day mortality (OR 1.50, 95%CI 1.17-1.92) and in-hospital complications (OR 1.47, 95%CI 1.30-1.66). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in 1267 (32.7%) patients with heart failure; 146 (11.5%) patients with heart failure presented with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%. Reduced ejection fraction was associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.01-3.81). DISCUSSION: Stable chronic heart failure is independently associated with major adverse cardiovascular events, mortality and severe postoperative complications when measured 30 days after non-cardiac surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40230320/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

Reference ranges are derived from healthy volunteers but may not be interchangeable with those from patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Furthermore, sex and age seem to influence rotational thromboelastometry profiles. We performed a secondary analysis of two prospective observational study cohorts from a single centre in the Netherlands, which establishes pre-operative ROTEM((R)) sigma reference ranges for adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery and examines sex- and age-specific variations. METHODS: Reference ranges (2.5-97.5th percentiles) were compared with those reported by the manufacturer by calculating 95%CIs around the percentiles. Sex- and age-specific variations were evaluated similarly by creating subgroups (comparing males with females and different age groups) and calculating the 95%CIs for the ranges in each subgroup. Non-overlapping CIs indicated statistically significant different ranges. RESULTS: We included 381 patients in the analysis. Differences were found in ROTEM sigma reference ranges compared with those stated by the manufacturer: EXTEM and FIBTEM clot firmness upper limits were higher, and clotting time ranges in EXTEM and INTEM were wider. The lower limit of LI60 EXTEM was lower. When comparing males (n = 260) and females (n = 121), female patients had shorter CT EXTEM and higher A5, A10 and MCF in EXTEM and FIBTEM, but the reference ranges were not significantly different. No differences in medians or reference bounds were found across four age categories, divided by quartiles. DISCUSSION: Reference ranges for patients undergoing cardiac surgery differed from the manufacturer reference ranges. Pre-operatively, female patients exhibited a slightly more hypercoagulable ROTEM profile than males when comparing medians, though the reference ranges were similar. No differences were found across age categories. Cardiovascular-specific, but not sex- or age-specific ROTEM sigma reference ranges might be needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40230308/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08
40227959,Anesthesiology,Development of the Pediatric Scale for Quality of Recovery (PedSQoR).,Graydon C; Stricker PA; Kelleher S; Cravero J; Karim N; Muhly WT; Lee-Archer P,"BACKGROUND: Measuring the quality of a patient's recovery is vital, and reliable patient-centered outcome metrics are needed for clinical investigations and quality improvement. Currently, assessment tools to measure quality of recovery in pediatric patients are lacking. This study aimed to develop a scale to assess the quality of recovery construct in pediatric patients. METHODS: Using a mixed-methods investigative model, item generation was achieved using two complementary approaches. First, a comprehensive review of the literature identified tools and questions that assessed the endpoints relevant to recovery in children. Questions were categorized and then assessed by an expert Delphi panel who determined the most significant domains and items to be included. Concurrently, semistructured interviews were conducted with patients and their families to identify themes related to recovery that were important to patients and families. The resulting pilot questionnaire was administered to patients and their families presenting for elective surgery in the United States and Australia. RESULTS: The literature search identified 41 instruments, comprising 216 questions relevant to recovery. After the initial Delphi round, the item list was reduced to 91 questions, and then to 50 questions after the second round. The themes identified in the semistructured interviews aligned with domains considered important by a panel of experts. A 50-item questionnaire was administered to 1,162 children at multiple timepoints after surgery. Item reduction and factor analysis resulted in the 20-item Pediatric Scale for Quality of Recovery that assesses the domains relevant to physical and psychologic recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The Pediatric Scale for Quality of Recovery scale is a 20-item questionnaire designed to provide a holistic representation of a child's physical, emotional, and psychologic recovery after surgery and anesthesia. It was developed and validated with consumer involvement and a strong patient-centered focus. Once further validation has been established, it is expected to become a standardized endpoint in pediatric perioperative trials and quality improvement projects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227959/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

OBJECTIVE: To study the median effective dose (ED 50 ) and 95 percentile of the effective dose (ED 95 ) of remimazolam for successful sedation in children with CHD. DESIGN: A nonrandomised, nonblinded study based on the Dixon sequential method. SETTING: Tertiary hospitals in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, study dates: 20 October 2023 to 18 May 2024. PATIENTS: A total of 78 patients, comprising 32 males and 45 females, successfully completed the study. They were selected based on the following criteria: children aged 1 to 6 years with left-to-right shunt CHD; ASA physical status II-III. The key exclusion criteria were: history of allergy to sedative drugs; administration of sedative medications other than the study drug before surgery; severe pre-operative liver or kidney dysfunction; pre-operative bradycardia; and severe pre-operative respiratory diseases. INTERVENTION: The sedation status of the patients was observed for 5 min after intravenous administration of different doses of remimazolam. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ED 50 and ED 95 of remimazolam for successful sedation in children with CHD. RESULTS: The ED 50 (95% CI) of remimazolam for successful sedation in infants, toddlers and preschool children with CHD were 0.209 (0.184 to 0.234) mg kg -1 , 0.259 (0.234 to 0.284) mg kg -1 and 0.266 (0.207 to 0.325) mg kg -1 , respectively. ED 95 (95% CI) were 0.356 (0.282 to 0.672) mg kg -1 , 0.404 (0.330 to 0.741) mg kg -1 and 0.408 (0.334 to 0.752) mg kg -1 , respectively. No serious adverse reactions were observed with intravenous remimazolam.

This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine how low doses of propofol, dexmedetomidine, and fentanyl affect the brain systems for memory encoding and pain perception. METHODS: This was a single-blind, 1:1:1, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of 92 healthy volunteers ages 18 to 40 yr. Effect-site concentrations were targeted for propofol (1.0 mcg/ml), dexmedetomidine (0.15 ng/ml), or fentanyl (0.9 ng/ml). Participants listened to a series of 80 words creating a mental picture. Thirty were accompanied by a 2-s painful shock. Blood oxygen-weighted images were obtained at 7 T using a custom head coil. The primary outcome was next-day memory performance, measured by d', a normalized measure of correct identifications versus false positives. Mixed models were fit to test outcome differences between drug groups. Only statistically significant ( P < 0.05) changes are reported, after adjustment for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Recollection, reported as mean d' (95% CI), was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.34) under no drug. This was reduced under propofol (0.51; 95% CI, 0.182 to 0.842; P = 0.006) but not under dexmedetomidine (1.04; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.35; P = 0.99) or fentanyl (0.98; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.28; P = 0.99). Propofol decreased memory-encoding activation of the hippocampus and amygdala. Propofol reduced pain-related activation in the insula, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and amygdala. Dexmedetomidine showed decreased memory-related activation in the hippocampus but did not change pain ratings or show activation differences in pain-processing areas. Fentanyl showed decreased memory activation in the hippocampus and amygdala. During painful stimulation, fentanyl decreased activation in the primary somatosensory cortex and insula and increased activation in the anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: These findings add important details to the complex framework of how these distinct anesthetics affect different aspects of cognition through diverse neuroanatomic targets in the brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40203181/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

Effective pharmacologic interventions to mitigate these risks are urgently needed. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of perioperative nitric oxide (NO) administration in preventing AKI and limiting CKD progression in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: A total of 136 patients with CKD undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized into two equal groups: the NO group (n = 68), receiving 80 parts per million NO during the intraoperative period and for 6 h postsurgery, and the control group (n = 68), receiving a sham treatment. The primary outcome was AKI incidence within 7 days postsurgery. RESULTS: AKI incidence was significantly lower in the NO group (16 of 68 patients, 23.5%) compared to the control group (27 of 68 patients, 39.7%) with a relative risk of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.99; P = 0.043). Six months postsurgery, the glomerular filtration rate was higher in the NO group (50 ml . min -1 . 1.73 m -2 [45; 54]) compared to the control group (45 ml . min -1 . 1.73 m -2 [41; 51]; P = 0.038). Postoperative pneumonia was significantly less frequent in the NO group: 10 of 68 (14.7%) versus 20 of 68 (29.4%) with a relative risk of 0.5 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.99; P = 0.039). NO administration was safe: methemoglobin and nitrogen dioxide levels remained within acceptable ranges, oxidative-nitrosyl stress did not increase, and there were no significant differences between the groups in blood transfusion requirements, platelet counts, or postoperative blood loss volumes. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative NO administration in CKD patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is safe, reduces the incidence of AKI, and slows the progression of renal dysfunction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40203179/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intra-operative ventilation strategy, including tidal volumes, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and use of recruitment manoeuvres on the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in adults having non-cardiothoracic surgery. METHODS: Relevant databases were searched to identify randomised controlled trials that directly compared intra-operative ventilation strategies among surgical patients who were followed up for > 24 hours postoperatively and reported at least one outcome of interest. RESULTS: A total of 51 randomised controlled trials were included. Compared with a high tidal volume/zero PEEP strategy, low tidal volume strategies likely reduced the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications when combined with: high PEEP (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95%CI 0.22-0.87); high PEEP with recruitment manoeuvres (RR 0.60, 95%CI 0.49-0.75); personalised PEEP with recruitment manoeuvres (RR 0.53, 95%CI 0.42-0.69); low PEEP (RR 0.63, 95%CI 0.50-0.78); and low PEEP with recruitment manoeuvres (RR 0.65, 95%CI 0.46-0.93) (all moderate certainty evidence). Compared with a low tidal volume/low PEEP strategy, a low tidal volume strategy with personalised PEEP likely reduces the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (RR 0.85, 95%CI 0.73-0.99, moderate certainty). DISCUSSION: Among patients undergoing non-cardiothoracic surgery, the use of intra-operative low tidal volume ventilation with a range of acceptable PEEP levels likely reduced the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications compared with high tidal volumes and zero PEEP. This study highlights the need for implementation research at both the provider and system levels to improve intra-operative adherence to lung protective ventilation strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40133080/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08
40127959,Anaesthesia,The use of iron after surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Lim J; Joo J; MacLean B; Richards T,"INTRODUCTION: Anaemia in patients having surgery is associated with worse postoperative outcomes. Management with intravenous iron is an attractive therapeutic option, however, pre-operative intravenous iron administration is challenging. Evidence from interventional trials suggests that the greatest benefit is after hospital discharge. As anaemia is common after surgery, this meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of postoperative iron therapy to increase haemoglobin levels. METHODS: Relevant databases were searched from inception to 6 April 2023. Randomised controlled trials in adults undergoing elective surgery with postoperative anaemia, comparing intravenous or oral iron with control groups were included. The primary outcome was haemoglobin level at the end of study. Secondary outcomes included quality of life; blood transfusion requirements; incidence of adverse events; requirement for readmission; and mortality. RESULTS: Fifteen randomised controlled trials including 1865 patients were identified. Seven studies investigated intravenous iron, six investigated oral iron and two compared intravenous with oral iron. Intravenous iron increased postoperative haemoglobin levels compared with placebo or no intervention (mean difference 4.51 g.l(-1), 95%CI 2.63-6.38, I(2) = 0%, p < 0.01), while oral iron was ineffective (mean difference 0.61 g.l(-1), 95%CI -2.79-4.01, I(2) = 23%, p = 0.66). The subgroup analysis identified patients after orthopaedic surgery as the group with the greatest benefit (mean difference 3.63 g.l(-1), 95%CI 0.78-6.47, I(2) = 20%, p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION: Our meta-analysis of iron therapy for treating anaemia after major surgery found that intravenous iron administered within 30 days of surgery increased haemoglobin levels effectively, whereas oral iron showed no benefit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40127959/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

Both fluids and vasopressors increase blood pressure (BP) by inducing different physiological response. We devised a protocol which relies on dynamic arterial elastance (Ea dyn ) to guide BP optimisation during major abdominal surgery, and tested its effectiveness on tissue perfusion. OBJECTIVE: To explore if an Ea dyn -based optimisation protocol could affect lactate levels, fluid administration, and postoperative clinical complications. DESIGN: Randomised open-label clinical trial. SETTING: High-volume tertiary care centre for pancreatic surgery. PATIENTS: From 58 patients scheduled for cephalic duodenopancreatectomy 46 were eligible for the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the lactate value one hour after extubation. Secondary endpoints were fluid balance, intra-operative hypotension and postoperative complications. In the control group, hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg) was treated based on stroke volume variation (SVV) while in the experimental group the treatment was based on assessment of dynamic arterial elastance (Ea dyn group). Patient demographic and pre-operative laboratory data were recorded. All haemodynamic data, including oxygen delivery and consumption, were recorded at four time points: after intubation (T0), after fascia opening (T1), after fascia closing (T2) and one hour after extubation (T3). RESULTS: The patients were 70 [63 to 76] years and 15 (33%) were ASA 3. Lactate levels at T3 were similar between the control and Ea dyn groups. Oxygen consumption was higher in the Ea dyn group at T3, and lactate had a significant percentage decrease from T2 to T3: median [IQR], -24.5 [-30 to -14] vs. 0 [-24 to 7.6]%, P  = 0.004). Those in Ea dyn group received more vasopressors and had a lower fluid balance at T3: 2700 [2100 to 3800] vs. 2200 [1060 to 3000] ml, P  = 0.020). There were no significant differences either in postoperative complications or hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: A protocol including Ea dyn to treat hypotension did not reduce lactate after major abdominal surgery, but it was associated with a significant reduction in fluid balance and increase in oxygen consumption.

40070011,Anaesthesia,Outcomes for patients with alcohol-related liver disease admitted to Scottish intensive care units 2010-2018.,Shariff A; Rhode S; Forbes SJ; Lone N; Docherty A,"INTRODUCTION: Alcohol-related liver disease is recognised as a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to report the prevalence of, and outcomes from, alcohol-related liver disease after admission to ICUs in Scotland. METHODS: We performed a secondary data analysis using linked Scottish national databases of all adult general ICUs in Scotland. We compared emergency non-surgical patients admitted to ICU with and without alcohol-related liver disease. The primary outcome was ICU mortality, and secondary outcomes were ICU admission rate ratio; 60-day mortality; 2-year mortality; duration of ICU and hospital stay; and need for hospital readmission. RESULTS: Of the 49,420/103,103 (47.9%) patients admitted to ICU with emergency non-surgical diagnoses between 2010 and 2018, we identified 2629/49,420 (5.3%) patients with alcohol-related liver disease. Patients with alcohol-related liver disease were more likely to receive three-organ support (14.0% vs. 10.0%, p < 0.001). Mortality in the ICU was higher in patients with alcohol-related liver disease (964/2629 (36.7%) vs. 10,517/46,791 (22.5%), respectively; aOR 2.03 (95%CI 1.85-2.24)). Patients with alcohol-related liver disease who specifically presented to ICU with a gastrointestinal bleed had a lower ICU mortality (95/487 (19.5%)). Sixty-day mortality of patients with alcohol-related liver disease increased with higher levels of organ support (186/516 (36.0%) mortality with zero organs supported vs. 162/196 (82.7%) mortality with three organs supported). DISCUSSION: Early mortality was high in patients with alcohol-related liver disease who were admitted to ICU, especially if multi-organ support was required. However, nearly one-fifth of patients on multi-organ support survived to hospital discharge. Early mortality for patients with alcohol-related liver disease admitted with a gastrointestinal bleed was considerably lower and should be taken into consideration when considering management in ICU. In discussion with the patient and hepatologists, a trial of organ support with continuous re-evaluation may be appropriate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40070011/,2025 Aug,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the effect of dexmedetomidine on the incidence of emergence agitation during anaesthetic recovery in patients undergoing nasal surgeries under general anaesthesia. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted in Embase, Web of Science (all databases), Cochrane Library and PubMed up to 20 June 2024, following the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook and the PRISMA statement. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Adult patients undergoing nasal surgeries under general anaesthesia (P), peri-operative dexmedetomidine use (I), placebo (C) and emergence agitation assessment (O). RESULTS: Nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 620 patients were included in the analysis. The incidence of emergence agitation with the use of dexmedetomidine was significantly lower than with placebo (relative risk (RR) = 0.31, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.49, P  < 0.0001, I2  = 63%, GRADE: moderate). No significant difference was found in the incidence of severe emergence agitation (RR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.02, P  = 0.0552, I2  = 0%, GRADE: Very low). A trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to assess the reliability of the findings, with parameters set at a type 1 error (alpha) of 5% and a power (1-beta) of 80%. TSA confirmed the result for emergence agitation, but did not reach required information size for severe emergence agitation. Both assessment results were consistent and not dependent on any single study, as shown by the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The use of dexmedetomidine significantly reduces the incidence of emergence agitation in patients undergoing nasal surgeries under general anaesthesia.

Peri-operative immune dysregulation is likely induced by surgical damage and anaesthetics, but remains far from comprehensively characterised. To address this, the effects of individual drugs on immune function must be explored. Sugammadex, a cyclodextrin that encapsulates rocuronium, also binds other drugs and structures and may influence the inflammatory response. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the potential immunomodulatory effect of sugammadex. DESIGN: An in-vitro experiment, randomised controlled pilot study and retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve healthy donors, 20 adults undergoing total hip arthroplasty and 1000 major abdominal surgery patients. INTERVENTION: In vitro: isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to sugammadex and rocuronium before stimulation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS).Pilot study: patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under single shot spinal anaesthesia randomised to sugammadex (8 mg kg -1 ) or placebo at the end of surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: In vitro: TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6 production capacity.Pilot study: Ex-vivo cytokine production capacity after whole blood stimulation with LPS.Retrospective cohort: sugammadex as a predictor of postoperative infectious complications. RESULTS: In vitro : rocuronium suppressed TNF and IL-1beta production capacity. Higher doses of sugammadex (100 and 1000 mug ml -1 ; 100 mug ml -1 corresponds to plasma concentration reached upon 8 mg kg -1 sugammadex) restored suppression of TNF and IL-1beta.Pilot study: no differences in ex-vivo cytokine production capacity between the sugammadex and placebo group at the end of surgery or on postoperative day 1.Retrospective cohort study : no association between sugammadex and postoperative infectious complications (OR = 1.000, 95% CI 0.998 to 1.002). CONCLUSION: Sugammadex preserved cytokine production capacity of TNF and IL-1beta in vitro . The clinical pilot study and retrospective cohort study revealed no early postoperative immunomodulatory effects for sugammadex in the clinically used dosing range.

Gut microbiota produces various metabolites and influences the brain function and development of the host. This relationship is referred to as the gut-brain axis. Gut microbiota may influence developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity caused by sevoflurane exposure. This study investigated the effect of changes in the composition of gut microbiota after fecal microbiota transplantation on spatial learning disability caused by developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity in neonatal rats. METHODS: Neonatal rats were allocated into the Control (n = 10) and Sevo (n = 10) groups in Experiment 1 and the Sevo (n = 20) and Sevo+FMT (n = 20) groups in Experiment 2, according to the randomly allocated mothers' group. The rats in Sevo and Sevo+FMT groups were exposed to 2.1% sevoflurane for 2 hours on postnatal days 7 to 13. Neonatal rats in the Sevo+FMT group received fecal microbiota transplantation immediately after sevoflurane exposure on postnatal days 7 to 13. The samples for fecal microbiota transplantation were obtained from nonanesthetized healthy adult rats. Behavioral tests, including Open field, Y-maze, Morris water maze, and reversal Morris water maze tests, were performed to evaluate spatial learning ability on postnatal days 26 to 39. RESULTS: Experiment 1 revealed that sevoflurane exposure significantly altered the gut microbiota composition. The relative abundance of Roseburia (effect value: 1.01) and Bacteroides genus (effect value: 1.03) increased significantly after sevoflurane exposure, whereas that of Lactobacillus (effect value: -1.20) decreased significantly. Experiment 2 revealed that fecal microbiota transplantation improved latency to target (mean +/- SEM; Sevo group: 9.7 +/- 8.2 seconds vs, Sevo+FMT group: 2.7 +/- 2.4 seconds, d =1.16, 95% confidence interval: -12.7 to -1.3 seconds, P = .019) and target zone crossing times (Sevo group: 2.4 +/- 1.6 vs, Sevo+FMT group: 5.4 +/- 1.4, d =1.99, 95% confidence interval: 2.0-5.0, P < .001) in the reversal Morris water maze test. Microbiota analysis revealed that the alpha-diversity of gut microbiota increased after fecal microbiota transplantation. Similarly, the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum (effect value: 1.44), Ruminococcus genus (effect value: 1.69), and butyrate-producing bacteria increased after fecal microbiota transplantation. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation increased the fecal concentration of butyrate and induced histone acetylation and the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus, thereby suppressing neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The alternation of gut microbiota after fecal microbiota transplantation influenced spatial learning ability in neonatal rats with developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity. Modulation of the gut microbiota may be an effective prophylaxis for developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity in children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39899452/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

We aimed to describe the pharmacokinetics of an intravenous bolus of methadone racemate in adult patients undergoing heart surgery with CPB. METHODS: We prospectively studied 29 patients aged 45 to 75 years scheduled for cardiac surgery with CPB who received methadone 0.2 mg/kg after anesthesia induction. Arterial blood samples (n = 10) were taken, before, during, and after CPB. Pharmacokinetic analysis was undertaken using nonlinear mixed effects models. RESULTS: All patients completed the study. The median [interquartile range] methadone concentrations decreased from 34.8 [23.9-48.2] ng/mL (10 minutes before CPB) to 18.2 [9.9-26] ng/mL after 60 minutes of CPB ( P < .001). A 3-compartment model adequately described the observed changes in methadone concentrations. The influence of CPB on methadone pharmacokinetics was best described by hemodilution in a fixed volume of 1.5 L (CPB circuit volume) and by sequestration from the CPB components (CL SEQ = 93.4 L/h, 95%CI 59-124, P < .01). The observed effect of CPB in methadone pharmacokinetics can be compensated by giving a supplementary bolus dose of 0.05 mg/kg at the end of CPB. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed a decay in methadone concentrations during CPB, which, in our modeling analysis, was attributed to hemodilution and sequestration within the CPB components.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39773745/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

Comorbid conditions are likely important predictors of CV risk in pregnant people. Currently, there is no way to predict which people with HDP are at risk of acute CV complications. We developed and validated a predictive model for all CV events and for heart failure, renal failure, and cerebrovascular events specifically after HDP. METHODS: Models were created using the Premier Healthcare Database. The inclusion criteria for the model dataset were delivery with an HDP with discharge from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2020. Machine learning methods were used to derive predictive models of CV events occurring during delivery hospitalization (Index Model) or during readmission (Readmission Model) using a training set (60%) to estimate model parameters, a validation set (20%) to tune model hyperparameters and select a final model, and a test set (20%) to evaluate final model performance. RESULTS: The total model cohort consisted of 553,658 deliveries with an HDP. A CV event occurred in 6501 (1.2%) of the delivery hospitalizations. Multilabel neural networks were selected for the Index Model and Readmission Model due to favorable performance compared to alternatives. This approach is designed for prediction of multiple events that share risk factors and may cooccur. The Index Model predicted all CV events with area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) 0.878 and average precision (AP) 0.239 (cerebrovascular events: AUROC 0.941, heart failure: AUROC 0.898, and renal failure: AUROC 0.885). With a positivity threshold set to achieve >/=90% sensitivity, model specificity was 65.0%, 83.5%, 68.6%, and 65.6% for predicting all CV events, cerebrovascular events, heart failure, and renal failure, respectively. CV events within 1 year of delivery occurred in 3018 (0.6%) individuals. The Readmission Model predicted all CV events with AUROC 0.717 and AP 0.022 (renal failure: AUROC 0.748, heart failure: AUROC 0.734, and cerebrovascular events AUROC 0.698). Feature importance analysis indicated that the presence of chronic renal disease, cardiac disease, pulmonary hypertension, and preeclampsia with severe features had the greatest effect on the prediction of CV events. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with HDP, our multilabel neural network model predicted CV events at delivery admission with good classification and events within 1 year of delivery with fair classification.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39504272/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08
39504268,Anesthesia and analgesia,Association Between Two Muscle-Related Parameters and Postoperative Complications in Patients Undergoing Colorectal Tumor Resection Surgery.,Gao D; Miao H; Sheng W; Liu L; Wang R; Shi H; Li T,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the associations of 2 preoperative muscle-related parameters, the third lumbar vertebra skeletal muscle index (L3 SMI) for muscle mass and the Hounsfield unit average calculation (HUAC) for muscle density, with the occurrence of postoperative complications among patients undergoing colorectal tumor resection surgery under general anesthesia. We hypothesized that muscle-related parameters are associated with the occurrence of postoperative complications. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective observational study. Adult patients who underwent colorectal tumor resection surgery under general anesthesia between 2018.09.01 and 2021.09.01 were enrolled. The last abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan images obtained within 3 months before surgery were used to calculate the L3 SMI and HUAC. The primary outcome was defined as the occurrence of any postoperative complications corresponding to Clavien-Dindo classification before discharge. The secondary outcome was defined as the occurrence of any severe postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade >/=3) before discharge. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between muscle-related parameters and incidence of postoperative complications. Patients' baseline demographics, past medical history and intraoperative parameters were adjusted in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 317 patients with a median age of 66 (58-72) years were included. Sarcopenia (muscle mass reduction) patients in our cohort and myosteatosis (muscle density decline) were present in 254 (80.1 %) and 79 (24.9%) patients, respectively. A total of 135 patients (42.6 %) developed postoperative complications. According to the multivariable logistic regression, myosteatosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-3.3, P = .039) was significantly associated with postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: A significant association was observed between myosteatosis and postoperative complications (corresponding to Clavien-Dindo classification before discharge), especially severe postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade >/=3) in patients undergoing colorectal tumor resection. Screening for myosteatosis with HUAC using the CT before surgery may help clinicians identify high-risk perioperative patients early.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39504268/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

39466672,Anesthesia and analgesia,Comparative Electroencephalographic Profile of a New Anesthetic and Anticonvulsant That Is Selective for the GABA A R Slow Receptor Subtype.,Maciver MB; McCarren HS; Eagleman SL; Davies FM; Jahangir A; Pal D; Mashour GA; Bertaccini EJ,"BACKGROUND: Anesthetics like propofol increase electroencephalography (EEG) power in delta frequencies (0.1-4 Hz), with a decrease of power in bandwidths >30 Hz. Propofol is nonselective for gamma amino butyric acid type A receptor subtypes (GABA A R) as it enhances all 3 GABA A R subtypes (slow, fast, and tonic). Our newly developed anesthetic class selectively targets GABA A R-slow synapses to depress brain responsiveness. We hypothesized that a selective GABA A R-slow agonist, KSEB 01-S2, would produce a different EEG signature compared to the broad-spectrum GABA A R agonist (propofol), and tested this using rat EEG recordings. METHODS: Male rats were studied after Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) approval from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense and the University of Michigan. Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane (3%-5% induction, 1%-3% maintenance) with oxygen at 0.5 to 1.0 L/min. Stainless steel screws were placed in the skull and used to record subcranial cortical EEG signals. After recovery, either propofol or KSEB 01-S2 was administered and effects on EEG signals were analyzed. RESULTS: As previously reported, propofol produced increased power in delta frequencies (0.1-4 Hz) compared to predrug recordings and produced a decrease in EEG power >30 Hz but no significant changes were seen within +/-20 seconds of losing the righting reflex. By contrast, KSEB 01-S2 produced a significant increase in theta frequency percent power (median 14.7%, 16.2/13.8, 75/25 confidence interval; to 34.7%, 35/31.8; P < .015) and a significant decrease in low gamma frequency percent power (16.9%, 18.6/15.8; to 5.45%, 5.5/5.39; P < .015) for all rats at +/- 20 seconds of loss of consciousness (LOC). Both anesthetics produced a flattening of chaotic attractor plots from nonlinear dynamic analyses, like that produced by volatile and dissociative anesthetics at LOC. CONCLUSIONS: KSEB 01-S2 produced a markedly different EEG pattern, with a selective increase observed in the theta frequency range. KSEB 01-S2 also differs markedly in its activity at the GABA A R-slow receptor subtype, suggesting a possible mechanistic link between receptor subtype specificity and EEG frequency band signatures. Increased theta together with depressed gamma frequencies is interesting because GABA A R slow synapses have previously been suggested to underlie theta frequency oscillations, while fast synapses control gamma activity. These reciprocal effects support a previous model for theta and nested gamma oscillations based on inhibitory connections between GABA A R fast and slow interneurons. Although each anesthetic produced a unique EEG response, propofol and KSEB 01-S2 both increased slow wave activity and flattened chaotic attractor plots at the point of LOC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39466672/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

Several preclinical studies have investigated xenon or argon as treatments in animal models of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). A systematic review of MEDLINE and Embase databases was performed. After screening of titles, abstracts, and full text, data were extracted from included studies. A pairwise meta-analysis of neuroprotective efficacy was performed using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was investigated using subgroup analysis, funnel plot asymmetry, and Egger's regression. The protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022301986). A total of 21 studies met the inclusion criteria. The data extracted included measurements from 1591 animals, involving models of HIE in mice, rats, and pigs. The meta-analysis found that both xenon and argon had significant ( P < .0001) neuroprotective efficacies. The summary estimate for xenon was 39.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.3%-51.1%) and for argon it was 70.3% (95% CI, 59.0%-81.7%). The summary effect for argon was significantly ( P < .001) greater than that of xenon. Our results provide evidence supporting further investigation of xenon and argon as neuroprotective treatments for HIE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39453983/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08
39413034,Anesthesia and analgesia,Developing a Wearable Sensor-Based Digital Biomarker of Opioid Dependence.,Carreiro S; Ramanand P; Akram W; Stapp J; Chapman B; Smelson D; Indic P,"BACKGROUND: Repeated opioid exposure leads to a variety of physiologic adaptations that develop at different rates and may foreshadow risk of opioid-use disorder (OUD), including dependence and withdrawal. Digital pharmacovigilance strategies that use noninvasive sensors to identify physiologic adaptations to opioid use represent a novel strategy to facilitate safer opioid prescribing. This study aims to identify wearable sensor-derived features associated with opioid dependence by comparing opioid-naive individuals to chronic opioid users with acute pain and developing a machine-learning model to distinguish between the 2 groups. METHODS: Using a longitudinal observational study design, continuous physiologic data were collected on participants with acute pain receiving opioid analgesia. Monitoring continued throughout hospitalization and for up to 7 days posthospital discharge. Opioid administration data were obtained from electronic health record (EHR) and participant self-report. Participants were classified as belonging to 1 of 3 categories based on opioid use history: naive, occasional, or chronic use. Thirty features were derived from sensor data, and an additional 9 features were derived from participant demographic and treatment characteristics. Physiologic feature behavior immediately postopioid use was compared among naive and chronic participants, and subsequently features were used to generate machine learning models which were validated using cross-validation and holdout data. RESULTS: Forty-one participants with a combined total of 169 opioid administrations were ultimately included in the final analysis. Four interpretable decision tree-based machine learning models with 14 sensor-based and 5 clinical features were developed to predict class membership on the level of a given observation (dose) and on the participant level. Ranges for model metrics on the participant level were as follows: accuracy 70% to 90%, sensitivity 67% to 100%, and specificity 67% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable sensor-derived digital biomarkers can be used to predict opioid use status (naive versus chronic) and the differentiating features may be detecting opioid dependence. Future work should be aimed at further delineating the phenomenon identified in these models (including opioid dependence and/or withdrawal) and at identifying transition states where an individual changes from 1 profile to another with repetitive opioid exposure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39413034/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

The traditional intrathecal, oral, or intravenous analgesics could only provide insufficient pain relief with many side effects. Thus, a more effective analgesia approach is required. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of placing the catheter of an intrathecal morphine pump in the prepontine cistern for the treatment of craniofacial cancer pain. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with primary or metastatic craniofacial cancer pain who received the catheter placement of an intrathecal morphine pump into the prepontine cistern in eleven medical centers from September 2019 to December 2023. Friedman test and pairwise signed-rank test were used to evaluate the difference in numeric rating scale (NRS) scores, the number of breakthrough pain episodes, dose of intrathecal morphine, and dose of systemic morphine equivalents (oral, patch, intravenous) from preoperative period to postoperative days 1, 7, and 30. P values were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni test. RESULTS: The study included 33 patients. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of NRS scores at days 1, 7, and 30 postimplant were 2.0 (1.0-3.5), 2.0 (1.0-2.0), and 1.0 (1.0-2.0), respectively, which was significantly lower than that before surgery (median, 8.0; IQR, 7.0-10.0; all P < .001). Compared to baseline number/d of breakthrough pain episodes (median, 6.0; IQR, 4.5-10.0), there was a progressive decrease in the number/d of breakthrough pain episodes at day 1, day 7, and day 30 postimplant, and the median (IQR) were 1.0 (0.0-3.0), 2.0 (0.0-3.0), and 0.0 (0.0-1.2), respectively (all P < .001). Approximately 78.8% and 96.7% of patients reported pain relief >50% at days 1 and 30 postimplant, respectively. Compared with that at day 1 postimplant, the proportion of patients with a pain relief rate >75% at day 30 postimplant also increased with continued intrathecal treatment. Compared to the dose of baseline systemic morphine equivalents (median, 228 mg.d -1 ; IQR, 120-408 mg.d -1 ), the dose of systemic morphine equivalents reduced significantly from 0(0-120) mg.d -1 at day 1 postimplant ( P = .001), to 0 (0-0) mg.d -1 at days 7 and 30 postimplant (both P < .001). Few patients reported perioperative adverse events, including nausea, constipation, hypotension, urinary retention, dry mouth, headache, and sedation. No severe adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Placing the catheter tip of an intrathecal morphine pump into the prepontine cistern could effectively relieve refractory craniofacial cancer pain with an extremely low total morphine dose requirement and few adverse events. This procedure could be considered in patients with severe refractory craniofacial cancer pain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39259695/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

METHODS: The RPG panel comprised 23 multinational multidisciplinary panelists, including a patient representative. An up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis constituted the evidence base. The Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, and the evidence-to-decision framework were used to assess the certainty of evidence and to move from evidence to decision/recommendation. The panel provided input on the balance of the desirable and undesirable effects, certainty of evidence, patients' values and preferences, costs, resources, equity, feasibility, acceptability, and research priorities. RESULTS: Data from 17 randomized clinical trials (n=898) and 9 observational studies (n=1934) were included. There was considerable uncertainty about the desirable and undesirable effects of ketamine monotherapy for analgo-sedation. The evidence was very low certainty and downgraded for risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency. Uncertainty or variability in values and preferences were identified. Costs, resources, equity, and acceptability were considered varied. Adjunctive ketamine therapy had no effect on mortality (within 28 days) (relative risk [RR] 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.27; low certainty), and may slightly reduce iMV duration (days) (mean difference [MD] -0.05 days; 95% CI -0.07 to -0.03; low certainty), and uncertain effect on the cumulative dose of opioids (mcg/kg/h morphine equivalent) (MD -11.6; 95% CI -20.4 to -2.7; very low certainty). Uncertain desirable effects (cumulative dose of sedatives and vasopressors) and undesirable effects (adverse event rate, delirium, arrhythmia, hepatotoxicity, hypersalivation, use of physical restraints) were also identified. A possibility of important uncertainty or variability in patient-important outcomes led to a balanced effect that favored neither the intervention nor the comparison. Cost, resources, and equity were considered varied. CONCLUSION: The RPG panel provided two conditional recommendations and suggested (1) against using ketamine as monotherapy analgo-sedation in critically ill adults on iMV when other analgo-sedatives are available; and (2) using ketamine as an adjunct to non-ketamine usual care sedatives (e.g., opioids, propofol, dexmedetomidine) or continuing with non-ketamine usual care sedatives alone. Large-scale trials should provide additional evidence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39207913/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

The objective of this study was to determine whether there was an association between a patient's race or ethnicity and the receipt of an antiemetic agent preoperatively, during surgery, and in the recovery room. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective study of adult patients (>18 years) who had undergone cancer-related operating room procedures under anesthesia between March 2016 and August 2021 was conducted. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to estimate the effects of covariates on antiemetic administration. RESULTS: Of the 60,595 patients included in the study, 3053 (5.0%) self-identified as Asian, 5376 (8.9%) as Black, 8431 (13.9%) as Hispanic or Latino, 42,533 (70.2%) as White, and 1202 (2.0%) as belonging to another racial or ethnic group. Multivariable analyses showed significant associations between a patient's race or ethnicity and the receipt of antiemetics in the preoperative holding area, operating room, and recovery room (all P < .001). In the preoperative holding area, White patients (8962 of 42,533 [21.1%]; odds ratio [OR], 1.188; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.100-1.283; P < .001) had higher odds of receiving an antiemetic than Black patients (1006 of 5376 [18.7%]). Intraoperatively, the odds were significantly greater for Hispanic or Latino (7323 of 8431 [86.9%]; OR, 1.175; 95% CI, 1.065-1.297; P = .001) and patients who identified as belonging to another race (1078 of 1202 [89.7%]; OR, 1.582; 95% CI, 1.290-1.941; P < .001) than for Black patients (4468 of 5376 [83.1%]). In the recovery room, Asian (499 of 3053 [16.3%]; OR, 1.328; 95% CI: 1.127-1.561; P < .001), Hispanic or Latino (1335 of 8431 [15.8%]; OR, 1.208; 95% CI, 1.060-1.377; P < .005), and White patients (6533 of 42,533 [15.4%]; OR, 1.276; 95% CI, 1.140-1.427; P < .001) had significantly higher odds of receiving antiemetics than Black patients (646 of 5376 [12%]). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study suggests significant differences between the administrations of antiemetics to patients of different races or ethnicities, with Black patients often being less likely to receive an antiemetic than patients belonging to all other races or ethnicities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39178159/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08
39137053,Anesthesia and analgesia,The Glass Ceiling in Global Health: Perspectives of Female and Male Anesthesiologists.,Matejic B; Nelson BD; Collins L; Milenovic MS,"BACKGROUND: Gender equity is essential for improving health outcomes globally. Despite comprising 75% of the global health workforce and dominating academic global health programs, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions in global health organizations. Our study aimed to identify potential gender differences in the beliefs and attitudes regarding barriers that women anesthesiologists encounter in pursuing careers and leadership roles in global health and to identify recommendations for improving gender equity in global health. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey focusing on career leadership opportunities and challenges uniquely faced by women clinicians in global health. We obtained permission from the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists to distribute our questionnaire to their leadership committee members during 2 months (May-July 2022). RESULTS: The questionnaire was distributed to 164 study participants with 67 individuals (44.8% female) based in 38 different countries completing the survey (response rate 40.9%). Overall, 47.8% of the participants aspired to a leadership position in global health and 58.2% agreed women face unique barriers to global health leadership (70.0% of women compared to 48.6% of men; P = .081). Female gender (odds ratio [OR], 19.22, P = .004) and divorced marital status (OR, 746.26, P = .004) were positively associated and African ethnicity (OR, 0.002, P = .017) was negatively associated with the perception of gender bias in their career growth. The main challenges included balancing work and family responsibilities, lack of female mentors or role models, gender-based discrimination, and limited opportunities for career advancement. Men acknowledged these challenges but reported personally experiencing them to a lesser extent, particularly concerning lack of opportunities ( P = .005), inadequate pay ( P = .000), and lack of training ( P = .000). CONCLUSIONS: Gender disparities exist in the pursuit of global health careers. This study underscored that more women than men perceive barriers in pursuing leadership roles in global health and that men generally encounter these obstacles to a lesser extent. Female representation in leadership positions could be supported through evidence-informed policies that promote work-life balance, improve mentorship, offer equal opportunities for career advancement and adequate pay, and combat gender-based discrimination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39137053/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08
39116012,Anesthesia and analgesia,Effect of In Vivo Administration of Fibrinogen Concentrate Versus Cryoprecipitate on Ex Vivo Clot Degradation in Neonates Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.,Downey LA; Moiseiwitsch N; Nellenbach K; Xiang Y; Brown AC; Guzzetta NA,"BACKGROUND: Neonates undergoing cardiac surgery require fibrinogen replacement to restore hemostasis after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Cryoprecipitate is often the first-line treatment, but recent studies demonstrate that fibrinogen concentrate (RiaSTAP; CSL Behring) may be acceptable in this population. This investigator-initiated, randomized trial compares cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen concentrate in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03932240). The primary end point was the percent change in ex vivo clot degradation from baseline at 24 hours after surgery between groups. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative blood transfusions, coagulation factor levels, and adverse events. METHODS: Neonates were randomized to receive cryoprecipitate (control group) or fibrinogen concentrate (study group) as part of a post-CPB transfusion algorithm. Blood samples were drawn at 4 time points: presurgery (T1), after treatment (T2), arrival to the intensive care unit (ICU) (T3), and 24 hours postsurgery (T4). Using the mixed-effect models, we analyzed the percent change in ex vivo clot degradation from a patient's presurgery baseline at each time point. Intraoperative blood product transfusions, coagulation factor levels, perioperative laboratory values, and adverse events were collected. RESULTS: Thirty-six neonates were enrolled (intent to treat [ITT]). Thirteen patients in the control group and seventeen patients in the study group completed the study per protocol (PP). After normalizing to the patient's own baseline (T1), no significant differences were observed in clot degradation at T2 or T3. At T4, patients in the study group had greater degradation when compared to those in the control group (826.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 291.1-1361.9 vs -545.9%, 95% CI, -1081.3 to -10.4; P < .001). Study group patients received significantly less median post-CPB transfusions than control group patients (ITT, 27.2 mL/kg [19.0-36.9] vs 41.6 [29.2-52.4]; P = .043; PP 26.7 mL/kg [18.8-32.2] vs 41.2 mL/kg [29.0-51.4]; P < .001). No differences were observed in bleeding or thrombotic events. CONCLUSIONS: Neonates who received fibrinogen concentrate, as compared to cryoprecipitate, have similar perioperative ex vivo clot degradation with faster degradation at 24 hours postsurgery, less post-CPB blood transfusions, and no increased bleeding or thrombotic complications. Our findings suggest that fibrinogen concentrate adequately restores hemostasis and reduces transfusions in neonates after CPB without increased bleeding or thrombosis risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39116012/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08

38861464,Anesthesia and analgesia,In Vitro Investigation of Insulin Dynamics During 4 Hours of Simulated Cardiopulmonary Bypass.,Schweizer T; Nossen CM; Galova B; Schild C; Huber M; Bally L; Vogt A; Siepe M; Nagler M; Fischer K; Guensch DP,"BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia is common in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. We hypothesize that intraoperative hyperglycemia may be, at least partially, attributable to insulin loss due to adhesion on artificial surfaces and/or degradation by hemolysis. Thus, our primary aim was to investigate the loss of insulin in 2 different isolated extracorporeal circulation circuits (ECCs), that is, a conventional ECC (cECC) with a roller pump, and a mini-ECC (MiECC) system with a centrifugal pump. The secondary aim was to assess and compare the relationship between changes in insulin concentration and the degree of hemolysis in our 2 ECC models. METHODS: Six cECC and 6 MiECC systems were primed with red packed blood cells and thawed fresh-frozen plasma (1:1). Four additional experiments were performed in cECC using only thawed fresh-frozen plasma. Human insulin (Actrapid) was added, targeting a plasma insulin concentration of 400 mU/L. Insulin concentration and hemolysis index were measured at baseline and hourly thereafter. The end points were the change in insulin level after 4 hours compared to baseline and hemolysis index after 4 hours. The insulin concentration and hemolysis index were analyzed by means of a saturated linear mixed-effect regression model with a random offset for each experiment to account for the repeated measure design of the study, resulting in mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the primary end points as well as of pairwise contrasts with respect to ECC type. RESULTS: Insulin concentration decreased by 63% (95% CI, 48%-77%) in the MiECC and 92% (95% CI, 77%-106%) in the cECC system that contained red blood cells. Insulin loss was significantly higher in the cECC system compared to the MiECC ( P = .022). In the cECC with only plasma, insulin did not significantly decrease (-4%; 95% CI, -21% to 14%). Hemolysis index in MiECC increased from 68 (95% CI, 46-91) to 76 (95% CI, 54-98) after 4 hours, in cECC from 81 (95% CI, 59-103) to 121 (95% CI, 99-143). Hemolysis index and percent change of insulin showed an excellent relationship (r = -0.99, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that insulin levels substantially decreased during 4 hours of simulated cardiopulmonary bypass only in the ECC that contained hemoglobin. The decrease was more pronounced in the cECC, which also exhibited a greater degree of hemolysis. Our results suggest that insulin degradation by hemolysis products may be a stronger contributor to insulin loss than adhesion of insulin molecules to circuit surfaces.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38861464/,2025 Aug 1,2025-08-01,2025,2025-08
40737083,Anesthesiology,Impact of the Standardized ICU Admission Ratio on Outcomes in Rapid Response System Activations: A Retrospective Multicenter Study in Japan.,Ono S; Uchino S; Tokito M; Saito T; Sasabuchi Y; Sanui M,"BACKGROUND: ICU admission rates after Rapid Response System (RRS) activation vary widely across institutions. This study examined institutional differences in ICU admission rates and their association with outcomes. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective observational study was conducted using a Japanese in-hospital emergency registry, including patients with RRS activation between 2018 and 2022. We calculated the ICU admission rate (ICU admissions/RRS activations) and the Standardized ICU Admission Ratio (SIAR; actual/predicted ICU admissions) for each of 35 participating institutions. The association between SIAR and outcomes was assessed using generalized estimating equation logistic regression with hospital-level clustering. The primary outcome was ""death within 30 days"", and the secondary outcome was a composite of ""Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) >/= 3 or death within 30 days"". Outcomes were defined as events occurring during hospitalization, within a maximum of 30 days following RRS activation. RESULTS: The study included 8,794 patients. The median ICU admission rate was 0.33 (IQR, 0.21-0.47), and the median SIAR was 0.98 (IQR, 0.75-1.17). In univariable analysis, SIAR showed a non-significant association with the incidence of ""death within 30 days"" (beta = -0.05, 95% CI [-0.12, 0.01]; P = 0.108) and a significant negative association with the incidence of ""CPC >/= 3 or death within 30 days"" (beta = -0.15, 95% CI [-0.27, -0.03]; P = 0.015). In multivariable analysis, a 0.1-unit increase in SIAR was associated with an odds ratio of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.97-0.99; P = 0.104) for ""death within 30 days"", and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.96; P < 0.001) for ""CPC >/= 3 or death within 30 days"". CONCLUSIONS: Higher SIAR values were significantly associated with a lower incidence of ""CPC >/= 3 or death within 30 days"". Greater ICU utilization after RRS activation may improve outcomes, though underlying mechanisms require further study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40737083/,2025 Jul 30,2025-07-30,2025,2025-07

The integrated stress response (ISR) is a key mechanism of translational regulation implicated in diabetic pain. In this study, we demonstrate that a reactive glycolytic metabolite, methylglyoxal (MGO), which is strongly associated with painful diabetic neuropathy, activates the ISR through the kinase general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2). Methylglyoxal disrupts elongating ribosomes, triggering the recruitment of ribosome quality control factors and collision sensors. GCN2 activation by MGO requires the ribosomal P-stalk, a critical sensor for elongation factors. Moreover, neuronal sensitization and mechanical allodynia produced by MGO are GCN2-dependent. Overall, this study links ribosomal elongation dysfunction to metabolic pain and identifies GCN2 as a novel analgesic target for diabetic neuropathy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40728533/,2025 Jul 30,2025-07-30,2025,2025-07
40728530,Pain,Cortical astrocyte activation triggers meningeal nociception and migraine-like pain.,Bree D; Zhao J; Stratton J; Levy D,"Cortical astrocytes were implicated in migraine attacks involving cortical spreading depolarizations and related aura symptoms. However, whether the activation of cortical astrocytes is sufficient to generate migraine headaches is unknown. We investigated the role of cortical astrocytes in migraine pain triggering using a DREADD-based chemogenetic approach to activate visual cortex astrocytes, assessing its effect on the responses of meningeal nociceptors, the development of migraine-like behaviors, and their dependence on peripheral CGRP signaling. In a rat model, activating cortical astrocytes was sufficient to induce prolonged ongoing discharge and mechanical sensitization of meningeal nociceptors. Cortical astrocytic activation also generated cephalic mechanical pain hypersensitivity, reduced exploratory behavior, and anxiety-like behaviors linked to migraine headaches. Blocking CGRP signaling with a monoclonal antibody suppressed astrocyte-driven meningeal nociceptor discharge and alleviated migraine-related behaviors. We propose that augmented activation of visual cortex astrocytes during cortical hyperexcitability events in migraine attacks with and without aura is sufficient to trigger meningeal nociception and the ensuing migraine pain. Our findings could aid the development of novel effective migraine treatments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40728530/,2025 Jul 30,2025-07-30,2025,2025-07

Therefore, assessing pain-related avoidance is important in both pain research and treatment. Despite a variety of available measurement instruments, a systematic analysis of their quality and limitations is lacking. We evaluated the measurement properties of instruments used to assess pain-related avoidance in individuals with chronic pain. A systematic review following COSMIN guidelines was conducted (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020181461), including an electronic search of Cochrane, PsycArticles, PubMed, PubPsych, Scopus, and Web of Science as well as grey literature from inception to January 2024. Eligible studies were English, German, or French publications that explicitly claimed to evaluate one or more psychometric properties of measurement instruments assessing pain-related avoidance in adults with chronic pain. Of 703 screened records, 140 original articles were included, covering 20 self-reported questionnaires, one therapist-reported outcome measure, and one performance-based measure. Based on the current evidence, only the Brazilian Portuguese language version of the Chronic Pain Coping Inventory and the Italian version of the Chronic Pain Coping Inventory-42 fulfilled criteria to be recommended for use. Although the commonly used Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia were the most extensively studied, the study quality was mixed. The review further highlights extensive research on internal consistency, reliability, and construct validity but reveals a lack of high-quality evidence on measurement error and criterion validity.

40728516,Pain,Prior use-dependent plasticity triggers different individual corticomotor responses during persistent musculoskeletal pain.,Zamorano AM; Kleber B; De Martino E; Insausti-Delgado A; Vuust P; Flor H; Graven-Nielsen T,"Movement repetition is crucial for pain interventions. It facilitates the rehabilitation of motor patterns, the acquisition of motor skills, and the genesis of adaptive use-dependent plasticity. However, the influence of prior motor experience and preexisting use-dependent plasticity on pain severity and progression remains poorly investigated. This study investigated the effects of preexisting use-dependent plasticity during the development of prolonged experimental musculoskeletal pain. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, corticospinal excitability was assessed by measuring the Rest motor threshold (RMT), motor-evoked potential (MEP), representational area of the motor map, volume, and center of gravity of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in musicians (n = 19), a well-known ecological model of use-dependent plasticity, and in nonmusicians (n = 20). All participants attended 3 sessions (day 1, day 3, day 8). Prolonged pain for several days was induced by intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) into the right FDI muscle at the end of day 1. Compared to day 1, prolonged pain uniquely led to reduced motor map volume in nonmusicians on day 3 (P = 0.004), who also showed higher NGF-related pain intensity compared to musicians. The motor maps of musicians, which were already smaller in pain-free conditions (day 1) compared to nonmusicians (P = 0.021), remained nonsignificantly different across days. Notably, corticomotor responses (map volume, MEP amplitude, and RMT) were correlated to weekly and accumulated musical training. These findings demonstrate that preexisting use-dependent plasticity associated with motor training may counteract the effects of prolonged pain in the motor system. Moreover, it confirms that prior motor experience acts as a source of individual variability to pain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40728516/,2025 Jul 30,2025-07-30,2025,2025-07

40727984,Anaesthesia,"Age, ASA physical status and surgical outcomes: insights from a nationwide cohort study.",Kilhamn N; Eriksson J; von Oelreich E; Jonsson Fagerlund M; Oldner A; Larsson E,"INTRODUCTION: With over 300 million surgical procedures performed worldwide annually and an ageing population with increasing comorbidities, peri-operative risk assessment is more important than ever. Whilst the ASA physical status is used widely to assess surgical risk, its association with age remains underexplored in contemporary, broad surgical populations. This study examines the relationship between ASA physical status, age and postoperative mortality in an adult surgical cohort. METHODS: This nationwide cohort study analysed data from the Swedish Perioperative Register on patients aged >/= 18 y undergoing major non-cardiac surgery from January 2019 to March 2023. Data on comorbidities, socioeconomic factors and mortality were retrieved from national health registries. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 365-day mortality and days at home alive at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 262,938 elective and 197,108 acute procedures were analysed, with median ages of 66 and 68 y, respectively. Crude mortality rates in elective surgery were 1369 (0.5%) at 30 days and 10,437 (4.0%) at 365 days. For acute surgery, mortality was 10,602 (5.4%) at 30 days and 27,912 (14.2%) at 365 days. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for 30-day mortality indicated a 14-fold increased risk for ASA physical status 3 compared with ASA physical status 1 in both elective (OR 13.7, 95%CI 7.5-25.0) and acute (OR 14.0, 95%CI 10.2-19.3) surgeries. Correspondingly, ASA physical status >/= 4 was associated with odds ratios of 62.2 (95%CI 33.5-115.5) for elective and 51.1 (95%CI 37.1-70.3) for acute surgery. DISCUSSION: As populations age and surgical demand increases, continuous evaluation of risk assessment tools like the ASA physical status is essential. This study shows a strong association between ASA physical status and mortality across all ages in a contemporary adult surgical cohort. These findings could enhance our understanding of peri-operative risk stratification in the context of shifting demographic trends.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40727984/,2025 Jul 29,2025-07-29,2025,2025-07
40727983,Anaesthesia,Views of people who have given birth on the environmental and occupational exposure risks of nitrous oxide for labour analgesia: an interview-based qualitative study.,Elgie L; Salih T; Moonesinghe SR,"INTRODUCTION: A 50:50 nitrous oxide/oxygen mix is commonly used for labour analgesia in the UK; however, nitrous oxide is associated with comparatively high environmental impact and potential exposure risks to staff if appropriate measures are not taken. Reduction of the impact of nitrous oxide in line with net zero emissions targets would require widespread changes in the way nitrous oxide is administered or in the availability of alternative options for labour analgesia. The aims of this qualitative study were to understand nitrous oxide use from the perspective of the parturient in the context of concerns regarding the environment and occupational exposure, and to provide evidence to guide the development of patient-centred nitrous oxide mitigation strategies. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with participants who had used nitrous oxide for labour analgesia. Participants were recruited purposively. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: We conducted 12 interviews and identified three themes: nitrous oxide is the default for labour analgesia in the UK; mitigating nitrous oxide harm depends on personal priorities; and institutions have a responsibility to mitigate nitrous oxide harm. Participants viewed nitrous oxide as a safe option, readily available in the context of limited choices for labour analgesia. They would be interested to know about the environmental risk of nitrous oxide, though this would not necessarily influence their choice to use it. They were less interested in its occupational risks and considered institutions, rather than individuals in labour, to have a responsibility to mitigate these. Though they felt that investment in reducing NHS emissions is important, participants also felt there may be other more pressing financial priorities. DISCUSSION: This study provides evidence to support the development of strategies to reduce nitrous oxide emissions, which consider the views of people who have used nitrous oxide for labour analgesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40727983/,2025 Jul 29,2025-07-29,2025,2025-07

The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block is a newer technique that may provide superior analgesia. We therefore designed this study in an academic emergency department to compare the acute analgesic effect of these two approaches in patients with a hip fracture. METHODS: Adult patients with an acute hip fracture who reported at least moderate pain were eligible for inclusion. Patients were allocated randomly to receive either a PENG block with 20 ml 0.375% levobupivacaine plus 4 mg dexamethasone or infra-inguinal FIB with 30 ml 0.25% levobupivacaine plus 4 mg dexamethasone. Primary outcome was the percentage of summed pain intensity difference (%SPID) calculated from visual analogue pain scores measured during the first hour post-block. Secondary outcomes included: number of patients reaching 33% and 50% SPID; dose of rescue opioid administered in morphine milligram equivalents; and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 92 patients were screened for eligibility and 64 were enrolled (32 in each group). Patients allocated to the PENG block group showed a greater %SPID when compared with those allocated to the FIB group (62.7% (95%CI 52.9-72.4%) vs. 38.0% (95%CI 30.7-45.4%), respectively; difference: -24.7% (95%CI -36.6 to -12.7%), p < 0.001). In the PENG group, 24/32 patients achieved 50% SPID compared with 7/32 in the FIB group (p < 0.001). Similarly, in the PENG group, 28/32 patients achieved 33% SPID compared with 19/32 in the FIB group (p = 0.022). There was no significant difference in the rescue opioid dose administered or in the incidence of adverse events. DISCUSSION: The PENG block provides superior analgesia for the first hour after intervention when compared with the infra-inguinal FIB and represents a promising modality for acute pain management in emergency departments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40727959/,2025 Jul 29,2025-07-29,2025,2025-07

We conducted computational analyses of publicly available human and mouse transcriptomic datasets to assess multiple myeloma (MM) microenvironment diversity and identify potential nociceptive interactions. Our results highlight the MM microenvironment heterogeneity and identify cell-type-specific ligand-receptor pairs that potentially stimulate sensory neurons. We tested 7 ligands identified from MM plasma cells and bone marrow stromal cells (insulin-like growth factor 1, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, neuregulin 2, Wnt Family Member 5A, thrombospondin 1, fibroblast growth factor 7, and semaphorin 6A) using Ca2+ imaging assays in primary cultures of sensory neurons to induce Ca2+ signaling or affect TRPV1 sensitization. The results showed increased intracellular Ca2+ levels upon the direct application of thrombospondin 1. To suggest potential targets for future analgesic drug development, we computationally identified MAPK14 and CSNK2A1 as putative regulatory kinases upstream of the identified ligands. Together, our analysis maps potential nociceptive signaling pathways of different MM microenvironment cell types. These pathways extend from upstream regulatory kinases to transcription factors to secreted ligands, which can potentially stimulate sensory neuron receptors in the bone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40721388/,2025 Jul 29,2025-07-29,2025,2025-07

It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic pain to effectively target it. To investigate peripheral mechanisms relevant to pain signalling, we isolated nerve terminals from mouse footpads of wild type and NaV1.9-deficient mice, which exhibit impaired pain sensation and chronification. The isolated peripheral terminals are functionally active and capable of endocytosis. They contain both pre- and postsynaptic proteins in samples from mice and humans. Components of the protein translational machinery and mitochondria are enriched in nerve terminals, and these components are altered in NaV1.9 deficient terminals. An unbiased proteomic analysis of nerve terminals from footpads of NaV1.9 knockout mice shows dysregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 pathways. Preliminary proteomic analysis reveals a strong similarity between mouse and human skin samples, highlighting the broad and translational value of our approach. Our findings uncover peripheral signalling mechanisms involved in nociception, paving the way for unprecedented translational approaches using human biomaterials in pain research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40719881/,2025 Jul 29,2025-07-29,2025,2025-07

These recommendations aim to improve the safety of children having their airways topicalised with lidocaine. RESULTS: The systematic review identified 26 articles, with 21 recommendations agreed across five domains of practice: dosing; recovery; adverse reactions; institutional responsibilities; and learning from events. Evidence was limited and mainly grades C and D but the strength of the recommendations, based on the expert consensus, was mainly moderate (65-79% consensus) and strong (>/= 80% consensus).

Two plausible theoretical response scenarios for prolonged painful stimulation could be hypothesised: If the organism does not sense potential harm an individual may habituate. Whereas, if harm is possible, pain sensitization may be more probable. Examining how an individual adapts to prolonged stimulation will provide unique insight into the mechanisms underlying pain habituation and sensitisation and, potentially, a valuable perspective on the development of chronic pain. However, currently little is known about the stability of these individual differences or their underlying neural mechanisms. To address this, 85 participants completed an MRI session, involving a noxious stimulation task and a resting-state scan. Habituation/sensitization was operationalized as the slope of change in pain ratings across the task. Habituation was associated with increasing activity in the anterior hippocampus and amygdala over time, with sensitization associated with increasing activity in the sensorimotor cortices. These regions were then used as seeds for a resting-state functional connectivity analysis, which revealed that habituation was associated with higher connectivity between the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, as well as higher connectivity between sensorimotor regions and the hippocampus, amygdala, and insula cortex. We have shown that habituation/sensitization to pain is a stable trait underpinned by differential activity in brain regions supporting sensory processing and appraisal. The perspective of these stable phenotypical patterns could have clinical applications and potential for improving our understanding of the development of chronic pain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40728514/,2025 Jul 24,2025-07-24,2025,2025-07

This study investigated the epidemiology of perioperative cardiac arrest in emergency and elective surgeries in Japan. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study using the Japanese Intensive care PAtient Database (JIPAD), a nationwide ICU registry. Patients coming from the operating theatre who experienced cardiac arrest before ICU admission between April 2015 and March 2023 were included. Patients were categorised as undergoing emergency or elective surgery, and group comparisons were performed for the incidence, surgical procedures, aetiologies, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Perioperative cardiac arrest occurred in 874/214 303 (0.41%) surgical ICU admissions, including 563/32 408 (1.74%) of emergency surgeries and 311/181 895 (0.17%) of elective surgeries. In emergency surgeries, the most frequent surgical procedure was acute aortic dissection repair (n=90, 16.0%), whereas the most common procedure in elective surgeries was gastrointestinal neoplasm resection (n=39, 12.5%). Acute aortic syndrome was the leading aetiology in emergency surgery (n=176, 31.3%), whereas valvular heart disease (n=48, 15.4%) and acute coronary syndrome (n=42, 13.5%) were the leading aetiologies in elective surgery. Both in-hospital mortality (46.2% vs 15.8%) and transfers to other healthcare facilities (28.8% vs 14.8%) were significantly higher in emergency surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study reveals significant differences in the incidence, surgical procedures, aetiologies, and clinical outcomes of perioperative cardiac arrest between emergency and elective surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40713194/,2025 Jul 24,2025-07-24,2025,2025-07

Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) to the dorsal root ganglion and epidural neuroplasty techniques are emerging as alternative interventional treatments. However, there are no direct comparison studies between PRF and epidural neuroplasty, leading to uncertainty in optimal treatment selection. OBJECTIVE: This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to indirectly compare the efficacy of PRF and epidural neuroplasty techniques in managing LRP. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We conducted a systematic review and NMA of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PRF, epidural neuroplasty, and conservative treatments, including ESI and sham procedures. Data sources included PubMed, Cochrane Central, Embase, and Web of Science up to December 31, 2024. Inclusion criteria comprised RCTs evaluating adult patients with lumbar radicular pain from disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or failed back surgery syndrome. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, interventions, outcomes, and risk of bias. The primary outcome was pain reduction at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The secondary outcome was disability reduction, measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). A frequentist random-effects model was used for data synthesis, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Prediction intervals were not calculated due to data limitations, which is acknowledged as a limitation. FINDINGS: 14 RCTs comprising 1229 patients were included. At 1 month, there was no significant difference between PRF and epidural neuroplasty. At 3 months, epidural neuroplasty showed significant advantages over PRF (mean difference: -1.47, 95% CI -2.73 to -0.46); however, the certainty of evidence for this comparison was rated low. Similar trends were observed at 6 and 12 months, but the confidence in these estimates remained low to very low. For ODI, no significant differences were found at time points, and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low across comparisons. CONCLUSION: PRF and epidural neuroplasty may offer comparable long-term pain and disability outcomes for patients with lumbar radicular pain, but the overall certainty of evidence was low to very low, limiting confident clinical recommendations. These findings highlight the need for high-quality, head-to-head trials to better inform interventional treatment strategies for LRP.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40707353/,2025 Jul 24,2025-07-24,2025,2025-07

Systematic, prospectively collected data regarding the accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring commenced immediately before surgery and throughout the early perioperative period are lacking. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients aged >50 yr undergoing noncardiac surgery who required at least 24 h of hospital stay. We used real-time continuous glucose monitoring (Dexcom G7 sensor, placed in the upper outer arm) (Dexcom, San Diego, CA, USA) with reference values from arterial blood glucose measurements by amperometry. The primary outcome was the overall mean difference (bias) before surgery, at end of surgery, and 24 h after surgery (Bland-Altman analysis). Secondary outcomes included the mean absolute relative difference and surveillance error grid analyses. RESULTS: We compared paired blood (73% arterial) and continuous glucose monitoring glucose values at each prespecified timepoint in 118 participants (64/118 [54%] female; mean age: 66 [range: 51-89] yr; 25% with diabetes mellitus). The overall bias between continuous glucose monitoring and blood glucose from measurements at each of the three timepoints in the first 24 h after induction of anaesthesia was 0.38 mM (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.23-0.53; n=340 paired readings). Bias decreased from before the start of surgery (1.08 mM [95% CI: 0.87-1.29]; n=116) to 0.15 mM at the end of surgery (95% CI: -0.15 to 0.46; n=113). Mean absolute relative difference ranged from 12.0% to 18.3%. Error grid analyses found that >98% continuous glucose monitoring values were within acceptable risk ranges.

40705855,Pain,Borders that hurt: the link between anti-immigration attitudes in Europe and the epidemic of chronic pain in immigrant adolescents.,Roman-Juan J; Hood AM; Marbil MG; Birnie KA; Noel M,"Global immigration is increasing and is expected to continue rising because of the growing frequency of environmental disasters and sociopolitical conflicts. Emerging research shows that adolescents who immigrated to Europe are disproportionately affected by chronic pain compared to their nonimmigrant peers. Anti-immigration attitudes, which are also rising in Europe, may contribute to this disparity by fostering social exclusion and discrimination, which can heighten psychological distress and contribute to chronic pain. Using an intersectional approach, this study examined (1) the association between country-level anti-immigration attitudes and chronic pain in immigrant adolescents and (2) whether this association differed by sex and socioeconomic status. Cross-sectional data were drawn from 5621 immigrant adolescents across 20 European countries using the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children 2018 survey. Country-level anti-immigration attitudes were obtained from the European Social Survey 2018. Weighted mixed-effects logistic regression models assessed the association between anti-immigration attitudes and chronic pain and tested for interaction effects with sex and socioeconomic status. Results showed that stronger country-level anti-immigration attitudes were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of chronic pain among immigrant adolescents (OR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.11-1.38) and that this association was stronger in immigrants with low socioeconomic status (OR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.08-1.77). Sociopolitical exclusion of immigrants may contribute to higher chronic pain rates in immigrant adolescents, especially those with lower socioeconomic status. Country-specific responses must acknowledge the public health burden of anti-immigration rhetoric. Findings underscore the need for structural interventions to reduce anti-immigration sentiments at societal and political levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40705855/,2025 Jul 24,2025-07-24,2025,2025-07
40705710,Pain,Chronic pain is associated with sleep apnea severity but attenuated by intermittent hypoxemia in people using opioids.,Orr JE; Bosompra NO; Norby B; Velazquez J; Khalaf A; DeYoung P; Schmickl CN; Sands SA; Jain S; He F; Goodin B; Wallace M; Owens RL; Malhotra A,"Patients using long-term opioids for pain often have uncontrolled symptoms which might drive ongoing opioid use and contribute to the opioid public health crisis. Opioids also cause sleep disordered breathing (SDB), which might impact pain via arousals and hypoxemia, with potential for a vicious cycle. Adults with noncancer pain using opioids daily for >3 months were recruited. Subjects underwent pain and sleep questionnaires, pain tolerance via 10 degrees C cold pressor testing, and polysomnography. Hypoxic burden was determined from polysomnographic signal analysis. Participants (n = 143) had a median (interquartile range) age of 60 (51, 67) years, body mass index 29 (25, 35) kg/m2. 80 (56%) subjects were female. The median daily morphine equivalent dose was 20 (10, 45). 78% had an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >5/hour and 41% with AHI >15/hour. PROMIS pain interference scores differed across SDB severity, with increased symptoms in mild and moderate but not severe SDB. With increasing AHI, there was worsened pain (beta = 2.2 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08, 4.4]; betastd = 1.3; P = 0.043), but this relationship was attenuated at higher levels of hypoxic burden (per interaction; beta = -0.42 [95% CI: -0.78, -0.06]; betastd = -0.85; P = 0.023). During cold pressor testing, there was a reduced time to hand withdrawal with increasing AHI (hazard ratio [HR] 2.60 [95% CI: 1.48, 4.57]; P = 0.001), but this was also attenuated at higher hypoxic burden (HR: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.78, 0.94]; P = 0.002). Overall, SDB is linked with worsened pain in those using opioids for chronic pain, but hypoxemia attenuates the effect. Individuals with the same AHI may have different symptoms depending on hypoxic burden.

40705707,Pain,Enhancing clinical translation of analgesics for neuropathic pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis on the role of non-evoked pain assessment in preclinical trials.,Huerta MA; Roza P; Cisneros E; Alique M; Roza C,"Current therapies for neuropathic pain are often inadequate and several promising preclinical drugs have failed in clinical trials. This may stem from an overreliance on reflex-based outcomes, which do not accurately reflect the spontaneous or non-evoked pain (NEP) characteristic of neuropathic pain. To bridge this gap, we evaluated the preclinical efficacy of standard analgesics in relieving NEP associated with neuropathic pain, thereby providing valuable insights that could optimize preclinical testing. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (July 2023). A random-effects model evaluated the effect of the intervention, with subgroup analyses exploring variability sources. Of the 91 included studies, 65 were eligible for meta-analysis, yielding 196 drug evaluations. Most evaluations involved traumatic nerve injury (91%) in male animals, although fewer were nontraumatic neuropathies (6%) or spinal cord injuries (4%). Standard pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain relieved NEP with efficacy patterns closely matching clinical results. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors showed the highest efficacy, followed by gabapentinoids and strong opioids, whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and mild opioids had no significant effect. Next, we confirmed that all the NEP-related behaviors were significantly alleviated by standard analgesics, validating that they are indeed pain associated. Moreover, drug efficacy was greater in traumatic nerve injury models compared with nontraumatic neuropathy models. In conclusion, standard analgesics demonstrated robust preclinical efficacy in alleviating NEP, mirroring their clinical performance. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating assessments of spontaneous pain into classical tests in preclinical studies to enhance the clinical translation of investigational analgesics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40705707/,2025 Jul 24,2025-07-24,2025,2025-07

Interactions between familial risk and obesity/hyperglycemia were assessed on an additive scale using the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Individuals with affected FDRs showed a 1.99-fold increased risk of disease, with twin, brother, sister, paternal, and maternal risks (95% confidence interval) of 17.53 (9.43-32.58), 2.57 (2.20-3.00), 2.38 (2.04-2.77), 1.72 (1.60-1.86), and 1.95 (1.88-2.03), respectively. In the interaction analysis, the combined risk of positive family history and high body mass index or hyperglycemia exceeded the sum of their individual risks (HR 3.33 vs 2.55, 2.51 vs 2.28, respectively), showing statistically significant interactions (RERI 0.78, 0.23, respectively). Obese individuals with a family history (RERI 1.12) showed a more prominent interaction than overweight individuals (RERI 0.26), and similarly, excess risk was higher in severe hyperglycemic (RERI 0.82) compared with moderate hyperglycemic individuals (RERI 0.28), suggesting a dose-response interaction pattern. Our interaction findings indicate that individuals with a family history and obesity/hyperglycemia should be considered a high-risk population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40705706/,2025 Jul 24,2025-07-24,2025,2025-07
40705703,Pain,Experience of endometriosis pain: a qualitative study.,de C Williams AC; Azadi A; McGrigor H,"Endometriosis is a common disorder in postpubertal women and often associated with pain in the pelvis and elsewhere. Pain and related symptoms, such as fatigue, adversely affect quality of life. Surgical and hormonal treatments have limited efficacy and can cause additional problems. There are surprisingly few studies of psychologically based interventions aimed at pain management and a better quality of life, although women with endometriosis are included within mixed chronic pain populations. As studies of pain management applied to endometriosis start to emerge, it is important to ascertain whether the assumptions of the dominant psychological model of pain, fear, and avoidance (developed mainly in musculoskeletal pain) are appropriate for the population and the problems associated with pain. We conducted a qualitative study of 16 women with endometriosis, using a very open interview technique (Grid Elaboration Method) and thematic analysis of women's accounts. We elicited 6 interrelated themes: 1 on the nature of pain; 3 on impact on everyday life, social life, and relationships, and emotions; 1 on healthcare experiences; and 1 on the burden of being female. Even when describing concerns about what was causing pain, women expressed few fears about physical integrity, nor did they avoid activities with the intention of protecting themselves from damage or increased pain. This leads us to question the applicability of the fear and avoidance model, and we encourage further exploration of the psychology of endometriosis-related pain to better design effective pain management interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40705703/,2025 Jul 24,2025-07-24,2025,2025-07
40704593,Anesthesiology,The role of supramammillary nucleus glutamatergic neurons in modulating consciousness transitions during propofol anesthesia in mice.,Li JY; Wu YH; Wang YH; Long S; Hu R; Huang WQ; Wang ZX,"BACKGROUND: Glutamatergic neurons in the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) have previously been shown to be pivotal parts of the wakefulness/sleep regulation system. However, whether they play a role in propofol-mediated modulation of consciousness remains unclear. This study hypothesized that glutamatergic neurons in the SuM contribute to the regulation of altered states of consciousness under propofol anesthesia in mice. METHODS: The effects of propofol anesthesia on neuronal activity were measured by calcium fiber photometry recording. Lesions and chemogenetic activation were used to investigate the role of glutamatergic neurons in the SuM in anesthesia induction, emergence, and sensitivity to propofol. Optogenetic methods were used to further explore the effects of SuM glutamatergic neurons or the projections from the SuM to the medial septum (MS) on cortical activity and behavioral changes during the maintenance of propofol anesthesia. RESULTS: Activities of glutamatergic neurons in the SuM decreased before propofol-induced loss of consciousness and rapidly increased at the onset of consciousness recovery. Chemogenetic ablation of glutamatergic neurons in the SuM reduced the induction time (mCherry vs. caspase-3, mean +/- SD, 150.1 +/- 25.3 s vs. 97.3 +/- 22.2 s, P < 0.001, n = 12) and prolonged the recovery time (1536.0 +/- 422.8 s vs. 2672.0 +/- 1048.0 s, P < 0.001, n = 12) under propofol anesthesia. Chemogenetic activation of glutamatergic neurons in the SuM had opposite effects. Optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic neurons in the SuM or the neuronal projections from the SuM to the MS induced behavioral arousal and cortical activation during the maintenance of propofol anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Glutamatergic neurons in the SuM and their projections to the MS contribute to the regulation of altered states of consciousness under propofol anesthesia in mice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40704593/,2025 Jul 24,2025-07-24,2025,2025-07

Here we describe the sensory-selective local anesthetic properties and the toxicity profile of a known metabolite of amino-amide local anesthetics, 2',6'-pipecolylxylidine (PPX). METHODS: PPX was synthesized and made into its hydrochloride salt. PPX or ropivacaine (ROP) were injected at the sciatic nerve or intrathecally in rats, who then underwent modified hotplate (sensory) testing and weight-bearing (motor) testing. Rats injected with PPX or ROP were assessed for clinical toxicity endpoints. Conduction blockade was studied with single-unit recordings in mice. Biocompatibility was assessed histologically. RESULTS: In male rats, sciatic sensory and motor block from 15 mM ROP lasted ~150 min; sensory nerve block from 30 mM PPX lasted 67.4 +/- 17.4 min without motor block. Addition of chemical permeation enhancers to 30 mM PPX abolished sensory selectivity. Intrathecal 15 mM ROP produced sensory and motor block lasting ~15 min; sensory block from 30 mM PPX lasted 24.8 +/- 8.7 min without motor block; repeated injection caused continuous sensory-selective block. In female rats, sciatic nerve blocks with ROP were similar to blocks in males, while blocks with PPX were sensory-selective but higher PPX concentrations were required. Ex vivo, 1.5 mM ROP caused reversible block of Adelta and C-fibers; 15 mM PPX blocked Adelta- but not C-fibers. Systemic 39.0 +/- 1.8 mg/kg ROP caused severe clinical toxicity; 75.3 +/- 3.2 mg/kg PPX caused none. Tissue reaction to PPX was benign, comparable to that of ROP. CONCLUSIONS: PPX provides sensory-selective local and neuraxial anesthesia with a good safety profile. The sensory selectivity may be attributable to the particular hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance of PPX.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40704591/,2025 Jul 24,2025-07-24,2025,2025-07

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the hyperangulated blade on haemodynamic changes during tracheal intubation. DESIGN: A prospective randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Tertiary, university hospital, single centre. PATIENTS: A total of 134 patients scheduled for general anaesthesia were included in the final analysis. INTERVENTION: Tracheal intubation using either a standard angle videolaryngoscope blade (Standard group) or a hyperangulated blade (Hyperangulated group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The occurrence of a transient decrease in heart rate or a transient sinus pause during tracheal intubation was recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of transient sinus pause was significantly higher in the Hyperangulated group compared to the Standard group (19% vs. 4%, respectively, P = 0.009). The percentage of the glottic opening score was significantly higher, and the incidence of backward, upward, and rightward pressure was significantly lower in the Hyperangulated group. The incidences of direct epiglottis lifting was significantly higher in the Hyperangulated group, and the total length of time of the blade in the mouth was significantly longer in the Hyperangulated group. Multivariate logistic analysis identified the use of a hyperangulated blade as an independent predictor of transient sinus pause during tracheal intubation (odds ratio = 5.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.53 to 21.53; P = 0.010). CONCLUSION: The hyperangulated videolaryngoscope blade is associated with a higher incidence of transient sinus pause than the standard angle blade during tracheal intubation.

40717606,Pain,Immersion in nature through virtual reality attenuates the development and spread of mechanical secondary hyperalgesia: a role for insulo-thalamic effective connectivity.,Medina S; Hughes SW,"Nature-based social prescribing has been shown to improve physical and mental health and is increasingly used to manage chronic pain. However, the mechanisms of nature-based analgesia remain unclear. In this study, we used immersive virtual reality (VR) alongside pain psychophysics, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and psychometric assessments to assess the brain-based mechanisms of nature-based pain relief. Specifically, we experimentally induced sensitisation within central nociceptive pathways using the high frequency stimulation model of pain in 30 healthy participants and tracked the development of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia across 3 conditions: immersive VR nature, nonimmersive 2D nature video, and no intervention. Immersive nature VR significantly reduced the development and spread of mechanical secondary hyperalgesia, with sustained analgesic effects correlating with perceived presence. Bayesian modelling of neuroimaging end points collected separately revealed that nature VR-induced analgesic effects correlated with insulo-thalamic effective connectivity. We propose that the analgesic effects of nature are likely mediated through top-down endogenous analgesic systems which could be working to reduce the development and spread of heterotopic plasticity in the spinal cord.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40717606/,2025 Jul 23,2025-07-23,2025,2025-07

However, the exact mechanisms underlying this interaction and its role in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) circuitry in pain regulation are under exploration. METHODS: We explored the role of P2X4R-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-TrkB signalling of ACC in regulating muscle pain (MP). Mechanical and thermal pain thresholds along with open field tests were used to assess pain and anxiety-like behaviours. Golgi staining, transmission electron microscopy, and patch-clamp recordings were performed to evaluate synaptic plasticity changes. Meanwhile, cFos staining and calcium imaging substantiate the neuronal excitability. In addition, we used chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to manipulate ACC neuronal activity. RESULTS: The ACC exhibited increased excitability, together with enhanced synaptic plasticity in rats with chronic MP. Microglial inhibition alleviated pain and anxiety-like behaviours. Furthermore, microglial P2X4R promoted BDNF expression, which acted on TrkB to regulate neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity in ACC; these effects were reversed by P2X4R knockdown and TrkB inhibition in MP. Chemogenetic and optogenetic suppression of ACC hyperactivity relieved chronic MP and anxiety-like behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight a critical microglia-neuronal communication via the P2X4R-BDNF-TrkB signalling, which enhances synaptic plasticity and cortical excitability in the anterior cingulate cortex, thereby participating in the regulation of muscle pain. Understanding how to assess and modulate microglia-neuronal communication and abnormal cortical activity will be key to developing novel therapies for MP disorders.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40707290/,2025 Jul 23,2025-07-23,2025,2025-07

Regional analgesia techniques such as thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) are effective but carry risks, whereas the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a newer, potentially safer alternative. We compared the efficacy of ESPB and PVB for managing acute pain after major breast cancer surgery. METHODS: This prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blind trial involved 292 women who underwent major breast surgery. Patients were randomised to receive either ESPB or PVB. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants requiring morphine within the first 2 h after surgery, and the secondary outcomes included pain scores, morphine consumption, complications, and participants satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 75.2% and 50.3% of the participants in the ESPB and PVB groups, respectively, required morphine, and the noninferiority criterion for ESPB was not met. However, morphine consumption was similar between the groups. Pain scores were greater in the ESPB group, especially during mobilisation, and ESPB provided less reliable dermatomal coverage than PVB, with the required area was not covered in 55.9% of participants in the ESPB group compared with 20.4% of participants in the PVB group. Satisfaction was similar between groups, with participants in both groups reporting high satisfaction. No major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with thoracic paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block did not meet the noninferiority criteria and was less effective for complete analgesia. Thoracic paravertebral block remains the preferred technique for major breast surgery.

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy decreases postoperative work of breathing and provides a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) effect. As a result, it may decrease the occurrence of diaphragmatic dysfunction and PPCs after thoracic surgery. METHODS: Single-centre, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy were randomized to receive conventional oxygen therapy (COT) or high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. In both groups, inspiratory oxygen fraction was titrated to reach a peripheral oxygen saturation of >94 %. Diaphragmatic displacement (DD) and diaphragmatic thickening fraction (TF%) were measured 2 and 24 h after surgery. Diaphragmatic dysfunction was identified by DD <10 mm. PPCs occurring within 7 days after study enrollment were recorded. RESULTS: We analyzed 116 patients in the study. Postoperative diaphragmatic dysfunction occurred in 17/58 patients (29 %) in the HFNC group compared to 21/58 (36 %) in the COT group (p = 0.55). The rate of PPCs was similar between the two groups: 32/58 (55 %) in the HFNC group and 37/58 (64 %) in the COT group (p = 0.449). Patients who developed postoperative diaphragmatic dysfunction experienced fewer PPCs when treated with HFNC (20/37; 54 %) compared to COT (17/21; 81 %) (p = 0.037). A post hoc mixed-model analysis confirmed that HFNC reduced the risk of PPCs in patients with diaphragmatic dysfunction (OR 0.16, 95 % CI 0.02-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Early HFNC support does not decrease the rate of postoperative diaphragmatic dysfunction rate or respiratory complications. In patients who develop postoperative diaphragmatic dysfunction, HFNC may play a role in mitigating the risk of PPCs.

It remains unclear whether spinal microglia respond to inputs from nociceptive fibers alone or require combined activity from nociceptors and nonnociceptors. Using electrical and optogenetic approaches, we selectively activated different fiber subtypes without causing neuronal injury. Our findings demonstrate that only simultaneous activation of both nociceptive and nonnociceptive fibers induces sustained hypersensitivity and a spinal microglia response. This response is characterized by increased cell proliferation, altered electrophysiological profile with hyperpolarized membrane potential, increased potassium currents, and a less ramified morphology. In contrast, activation of nociceptive or nonnociceptive fibers alone does not induce these changes. In addition, inhibiting spinal microglia with minocycline prevents those changes. Overall, our study suggests that both types of peripheral sensory input are necessary to elicit microglial reactivity in the spinal cord and the subsequent development of sustained pain-related behavior.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40705704/,2025 Jul 23,2025-07-23,2025,2025-07

This study examined symptom change over time and potential moderators in control groups of people seeking psychological pain management for chronic pain. After preregistration, we conducted a systematic literature search for RCTs of psychologically based treatment for chronic pain, which included a control condition whereby participants do not receive treatment (ie, waitlist control or no-treatment control). Meta-analyses were performed to determine that magnitude of symptom change across the control period for pain intensity, disability/interference, depression, and anxiety. Several potential moderators were also analysed. Data were extracted from 52 eligible studies (n = 2190), and the average control period was 13.5 weeks (range: 3-34). Overall, untreated participants demonstrated very small but statistically significant improvements in pain intensity (g = -0.07; CI: -0.13, -0.01) and disability/interference (g = -0.07; CI: -0.12, -0.01) over the control period. No significant change in depression (g = -0.06; CI: -0.11, 0.00) and anxiety (g = -0.05; CI: -0.11, 0.01) symptoms were observed. Some moderators were found. The findings suggest that people with chronic pain do not deteriorate or improve while waiting short periods of time for psychologically based pain management programs, contrary to some previous reports. Instead, the findings suggest that symptoms are relatively stable.

We have found that histone deacetylase Silent information regulator sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is involved in peripheral nerve injury-induced depression-related behavior in mice. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, using a mouse spared nerve injury (SNI) model, we found that SIRT1 was downregulated in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) of mice with peripheral nerve injury-induced depression-related behavior. SIRT1 overexpression in CeA glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons effectively alleviated peripheral nerve injury-induced depression-related behavior in mice. Moreover, peripheral nerve injury induced significant neuronal excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance in CeA, manifested by the increased glutamatergic neuronal excitability and decreased GABAergic neuronal excitability in SNI mice. SIRT1 overexpression in CeA glutamatergic neurons decreased glutamatergic neuronal activity without influence on GABAergic neuronal activity, while SIRT1 overexpression in CeA GABAergic neurons increased GABAergic neuronal activity and reduced glutamatergic neuronal activity in SNI mice. Moreover, optogenetic induction of neuronal E-I imbalance in CeA by activating glutamatergic neurons or inhibiting GABAergic neurons reversed the improvement of peripheral nerve injury-induced depression-related behavior by SIRT1 overexpression. These findings suggest that the dysfunction of SIRT1 is related to the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced depression-related behavior by decreasing GABAergic neuronal excitability and enhancing glutamatergic neuronal excitability, leading to the neuronal E-I imbalance in CeA. These results demonstrate that SIRT1 is a key regulator in peripheral nerve injury-induced depression-related behavior.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40705690/,2025 Jul 23,2025-07-23,2025,2025-07

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the postoperative analgesic efficacy of adding liposomal bupivacaine to brachial plexus block compared with non-liposomal local anesthetic. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library up to June 30, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the postoperative pain scores in patients who received liposomal bupivacaine via brachial plexus block were identified. The primary outcome was resting pain scores (Numerical Rating Scale, 0-10) at 24 hours after nerve block injection derived from the random effects model. A mean difference (MD) of 1/10 was considered to represent a minimal clinically important difference in pain scores. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied to examine the level of evidence. FINDINGS: 21 RCTs (1478 participants) were included. Liposomal bupivacaine was associated with statistically significant reduction in resting pain scores at 24 hours after nerve block injection compared with non-liposomal local anesthetic (MD=-1.04, 95% CI=-1.54 to -0.53, p<0.001, 95% prediction interval=-3.05 to 0.98). This was associated with significant heterogeneity (Q=107, p<0.001, I(2)=81%, tau(2)=1.0, 95% CI=0.42 to 2.07) and a low-GRADE rating. Liposomal bupivacaine was also associated with a statistically significant reduction in resting pain scores at 48 hours and 72 hours. Opioid consumption at 0-24 hours, 25-48 hours and 49-72 hours was lower in the liposomal bupivacaine group with statistical significance (p values <0.05). Liposomal bupivacaine was associated with a lower incidence of nausea. CONCLUSIONS: There is low-level evidence that liposomal bupivacaine in brachial plexus block may reduce pain intensity after upper limb surgery, but the clinical significance may be limited.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40701802/,2025 Jul 23,2025-07-23,2025,2025-07

These patients present unique challenges regarding perioperative risks. Large population data characterizing this group is lacking. The aim of this study was to offer an overview of trends in practices and outcomes among octogenarians and nonagenarians. METHODS: We utilized the Premier Healthcare database to identify patients undergoing TKA and THA from 2006 to 2022. Patients 80 to 88 years and 89+ years old were compared to those aged 65 to 70, the typical age group for TKA/THA recipients. We evaluated trends of practice pattern, patient demographics, and comorbidity burden. Multivariable models were applied to compare major complications. RESULTS: Neuraxial anesthesia was used more frequently among older patients undergoing TKA. Mean length of stay for both TKA and THA continuously decreased over time. Interestingly, octogenarian and nonagenarian TKA recipients had fewer comorbidities than 65- to 70-year-olds, while the reverse was observed among THA recipients. Multivariable analysis showed that among patients with similar comorbidity burden, octogenarian and nonagenarian patients had higher odds [95% CI] of major complications (TKA: OR 2.2 [2.0-2.4] and 2.7 [2.0-3.7] in 2006, OR 1.8 [1.6-2.1] and 2.0 [1.5-2.8] in 2022, respectively; for THA: OR 2.5 [2.1-3.0] and 3.7 [2.7-5.1] in 2006, OR 2.1 [1.8-2.4] and 2.7 [2.1-2.4] in 2022, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although THA/TKA patients appear to be in good health relative to 65- to 70-year-olds, age remains a significant risk factor for increased morbidity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40700091/,2025 Jul 23,2025-07-23,2025,2025-07

40701886,British journal of anaesthesia,Factors associated with a reduction in the preventive effect of intravenous dexamethasone on rebound pain after axillary brachial plexus block.,Touil N; Pavlopoulou A; Barbier O; Libouton X; Gruson D; Gala JL; Lavand'homme P,"BACKGROUND: Rebound pain after regional anaesthesia remains a significant clinical problem. Intravenous dexamethasone is commonly used as an adjuvant to prevent rebound pain although its effectiveness varies among patients. We aimed to identify phenotypic and biological factors influencing glucocorticoid sensitivity contributing to dexamethasone resistance in the prevention of rebound pain. METHODS: Patients undergoing ambulatory upper limb surgery with an axillary brachial plexus block were enrolled prospectively to receive dexamethasone (0.1 mg kg(-1) i.v.) before surgery. Preoperative factors analysed encompassed clinical aspects (central sensitivity, anxiety, and pain scores) and biological parameters (salivary cortisol, annexin-A1, and blood inflammatory markers). Postoperative outcomes comprised rebound pain incidence (numerical rating scale >7 within the first 24 h) and persistent pain at 3 months. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients included, 36 (34.6%) developed rebound pain. Preoperative nocturnal awakening pain (odds ratio [OR]=3.09, P=0.03), severe anxiety (OR=3.54, P=0.01), high catastrophising score (OR=4.14, P=0.01), and low salivary cortisol levels (<1147 pg ml(-1)) (OR=3.33, P=0.02) were associated with an increased risk of rebound pain. Persistent pain at 3 months (27%) was associated with the presence of postoperative rebound pain (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative nocturnal pain, severe anxiety, high catastrophising, and low salivary cortisol levels are factors that might reduce the efficacy of dexamethasone in preventing rebound pain. These findings support the development of personalised preventive strategies. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05763433.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40701886/,2025 Jul 22,2025-07-22,2025,2025-07

40705694,Pain,Upregulated natriuretic peptide B expression as a hallmark of chronic itch.,Tseng PY; Liew HL; Ringkamp M; Nagao K; Hoon MA,"Chronic itch can arise from a variety of etiologies, ranging from dermatological conditions like eczema and psoriasis to systemic diseases such as liver disease and kidney failure. However, it remains unclear whether there are common molecular features associated with chronic itch, and whether these features are selective for chronic itch compared to chronic pain. To identify potential genes or molecular characteristics that are specifically associated with chronic itch, we examined transcriptomic data from sensory neurons collected from 3 mouse models of chronic itch and a monkey model of contact dermatitis. We compared these data to transcriptomic data from 3 mouse models of pain and clinical data from patients with neuropathic pain. Our analyses revealed that the upregulation of Nppb expression in sensory neurons is consistently associated with models of itch, but not with models of pain. Further, our cellular characterization showed that the increased expression of Nppb arises from increased cell-autonomous expression rather than the recruitment of Nppb expression in other classes of sensory neurons. Given that Nppb is a well-established itch neurotransmitter, our findings suggest that the increased expression of Nppb in sensory neurons may contribute to chronic itch. In addition, based on our results, we propose that Nppb could serve as a conserved biomarker for chronic itch.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40705694/,2025 Jul 21,2025-07-21,2025,2025-07
40705693,Pain,Analgesic benefits of pharmacological and nonpharmacological sleep interventions for adults with fibromyalgia: a systematic review and meta-analyses.,Abolhosseini S; Malatesta A; Asmundson AJN; Gilron I; Salomons TV,"Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal pain condition affecting 2% to 8% of the population. Most people with fibromyalgia experience poor sleep, and sleep problems consistently predict pain severity. Given the bidirectional relationship between sleep and pain, improving sleep may reduce fibromyalgia pain. This review identified trials of sleep-focused pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions to evaluate whether they improved pain outcomes for adults with fibromyalgia. A systematic search of 7 electronic databases, 2 trial registries, and the reference lists of related studies retrieved 5728 records. Three independent reviewers completed study screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessments. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Sleep interventions were evaluated against inactive and active control groups in a total of 10 trials with self-reported pain outcomes. Sodium oxybate significantly improved pain compared with placebo (4.5 g: MD = -9.55, 95% CI [-11.97, -7.12]; 6.0 g: SMD = -3.41, 95% CI [-6.49, -0.32]) at postintervention. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for insomnia also significantly improved pain compared with usual care (MD = -5.47, 95% CI [-9.64, -1.30]) at postintervention. Comparisons of CBT for insomnia with sleep hygiene training, and combined CBT for insomnia and pain with CBT for pain showed no significant postintervention differences. Other interventions (eg, melatonin and zopiclone) were identified but had insufficient data to allow meta-analysis. This review provided preliminary support for the analgesic benefits of some sleep interventions for adults with fibromyalgia. Long-term effects of sleep interventions on pain should be investigated to further inform treatment planning efforts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40705693/,2025 Jul 21,2025-07-21,2025,2025-07

This study aimed to (1) examine the diagnostic performance of two ultra-rapid cognitive screening tools, the Ascertain Dementia Eight-item Questionnaire (AD8) and Mini-Cog, against a tool validated in surgical populations, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); and (2) compare preoperative patient-centered assessments and postoperative outcomes between those with and without cognitive impairment (CI). METHODS: CI was classified by scoring >/=2 on the AD8, </=2 on the Mini-Cog, and/or </=25 on the MoCA in non-cardiac patients >/=65 years old. RESULTS: Of 394 participants, 35 % had preoperative CI on the MoCA, 15 % on the AD8, and 12 % on the Mini-Cog. Both the AD8 and Mini-Cog demonstrated moderate area under the curve, with superior specificity over sensitivity. In contrast to the Mini-Cog, participants with CI on the MoCA and AD8 reported poorer preoperative patient-centered assessments than those without. Specifically, the AD8 was associated with poorer functional disability, frailty, anxiety and/or depression, pain level, sleep quality, and quality of life. Contrary to the MoCA and Mini-Cog, CI on the AD8 was associated with higher all-cause complications (15.1 % vs. 3.7 %, P = 0.003), emergency department visits (11.3 % vs. 2.5 %, P = 0.007), and composite adverse outcomes (15.1 % vs. 4.6 %, P = 0.008) at 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the AD8 and Mini-Cog demonstrated comparable diagnostic accuracy for CI, the AD8 provided additional insights into preoperative patient-centered assessments and 90-day adverse outcomes. Our study emphasizes the importance of preoperative screening for CI, highlighting the AD8 as a valuable tool.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40694882/,2025 Jul 21,2025-07-21,2025,2025-07
40691088,Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,The impact of local anesthetic systemic toxicity advisories on reporting to the National Poison Data System (NPDS).,Fettiplace M; Weinberg G; Nixon H; Barabanova A; Chiang C; Gitman M,"INTRODUCTION: In 2010, multiple anesthesia societies introduced recommendations for treating local anesthetic systemic toxicity, but the impact of those recommendations is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that reports of local anesthetic-related poisoning and mortality have declined since the publication of advisories in 2010. METHODS: We analyzed reports of local anesthetic poisoning and mortality from the American Poison Centers National Poison Data System (NPDS) spanning 1983-2022. We conducted a case-non-case disproportionality analysis using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) to evaluate the effect of the 2010 recommendations on reports of poisoning and death to the NPDS by comparing reports of poisoning and death from 2011 to 2022 relative to 2001-2010. Multiple linear regression and Poisson regression were used for confirmation, together with exploratory analyses of individual cases of mortality. RESULTS: In the decade following the introduction of recommendations (2011-2022), reports of local anesthetic poisoning decreased relative the prior decade (2001-2010, ROR=0.77, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.78, p<0.0001), driven by a decrease in non-lidocaine-related reports. Conversely, reports of lidocaine poisoning and reports of lidocaine mortality increased after 2010 (ROR=2.7 95% CI 1.3 to 5.6, p=0.0094). Case analysis revealed a decrease in reports of death in the operating room from 47% before 2010 to 15% after 2010, but an increase in reports of death from intravenous lidocaine delivery (3% to 27%, respectively). DISCUSSION: The decrease in poisoning reports aligns with the implementation of professional recommendations and advancements, such as ultrasound-guided nerve blocks and lipid emulsion therapy. However, the rise in reports of lidocaine-related deaths-primarily in emergency settings-underscores significant risks. These findings emphasize the need for improved guidance on lidocaine use and dosing strategies to prevent lidocaine-related mortality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40691088/,2025 Jul 21,2025-07-21,2025,2025-07
40690383,Anesthesia and analgesia,Prevalence of Point-of-Care Ultrasound Abnormalities and Raised Serum NT-proBNP in Early-Onset Preeclampsia.,Fantin RL; Uys F; Schuetz T; Flint M; Lombard CJ; Matjila MJ; Osman A; Swanevelder JL; Dyer RA; Ortner CM,"BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. A previous study in patients with late-onset preeclampsia (LOPE), showed an association between pulmonary interstitial syndrome (PIS), detected by lung ultrasound, and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). In early onset preeclampsia (EOPE); however, the cardiopulmonary status remains poorly characterized. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study enrolled women with EOPE with severe features. Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) assessments included lung ultrasound, TTE, and sonographic assessment of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). PIS was defined as the presence of bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound. An ONSD >5.8 mm was considered compatible with raised intracranial pressure. Serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and albumin levels were measured. The primary aim was to assess the association between PIS and elevated LVEDP in EOPE. Secondary aims included assessing the prevalence of POCUS abnormalities in EOPE and their association with serum NT-proBNP and albumin levels, and comparing the results with historical data from patients with LOPE. RESULTS: Sixty-4 patients completed the study. There was no association between PIS and elevated LVEDP (P = .53). PIS, diastolic dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and elevated LVEDP were observed in 23% (95% CI, 14.4-35.4%), 52% (95% CI, 39.3-63.8%), 30% (95% CI, 19.9-42.5%), and 35% (95% CI, 24.2-47.6%) of women, respectively. Increased ONSD was noted in 2 women (3%). Median (IQR) NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated (278 [119-678] ng/L) and associated with PIS (P = .015) and elevated LVEDP (P = .003). Using a threshold for NT-proBNP of 125 ng/L, the sensitivity and specificity for predicting PIS were 93.3% and 34%, and for increased LVEDP, 90.5% and 40%, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed limited diagnostic value of NT-proBNP for PIS (AUC = 0.78) and for elevated LVEDP (AUC = 0.68). No association was found between serum albumin and PIS, systolic dysfunction, or elevated LVEDP. The prevalence of systolic dysfunction was significantly higher (P < .01) and raised ONSD lower (P < .01) than in historical controls with LOPE. CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound and TTE showed a high prevalence of PIS, systolic dysfunction, and raised LVEDP in women diagnosed with EOPE. PIS was not associated with elevated LVEDP. NT-proBNP level was significantly associated with PIS and elevated LVEDP, however clinical predictive value was limited. Women with EOPE had a higher prevalence of systolic dysfunction than those with LOPE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40690383/,2025 Jul 21,2025-07-21,2025,2025-07

We conducted a randomized trial to assess whether high-flow nasal oxygen is noninferior to mechanical ventilation through a laryngeal mask in terms of success rate of intraoperative respiratory support among patients undergoing a 30-minute general anesthesia session. METHODS: Single-center, randomized, noninferiority trial conducted in Italy between May 2022 and June 2023 and involving American Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II patients undergoing general anesthesia for operative hysteroscopy. Participants were randomized to receive laryngeal mask ventilation (volume-controlled ventilation to obtain end-tidal carbon dioxide between 35 and 45 mm Hg, inhaled oxygen fraction to achieve peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 95%) or high-flow nasal oxygen (70 L per minute, inhaled oxygen fraction of 100%) for intraoperative respiratory support. Patients received general anesthesia with propofol target-controlled infusion without neuromuscular blockade. Primary outcome was intraoperative respiratory support success rate, which was defined as peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 94% and transcutaneous carbon dioxide lower than 65 mm Hg with no need for rescue airway interventions for the entire procedure. Secondary outcomes included the rate of airway-related complications (including need for bag-mask or laryngeal mask ventilation, or tracheal intubation), postoperative respiratory symptoms, and postoperative dyspnea. RESULTS: All 180 patients who were randomized completed the trial (90 patients in each group). Median [interquartile range] anesthesia duration was 25 [20-36] minutes in high-flow group and 32 minutes [27-44] in the laryngeal mask group. Intraoperative respiratory support was successful in 89 patients (99%) in both groups (absolute difference 0, unilateral 95% confidence interval, 3%, noninferiority P < .001). Incidence of postoperative respiratory symptoms was significantly lower in high-flow versus laryngeal mask group (2% vs 19%, P < .001), while airway-related complications and postoperative dyspnea were not different. Intraoperative transcutaneous carbon dioxide was significantly higher in high-flow group, with 43% of patients showing values greater than 55 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: High-flow nasal oxygen is noninferior to laryngeal mask ventilation for intraoperative respiratory support during 30-minute general anesthesia without muscle paralysis. The risk of hypercarbia warrants careful patient selection and monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40690380/,2025 Jul 21,2025-07-21,2025,2025-07
40690301,Anesthesiology,Evaluation of the potential for lung recruitment with the Recruitment-to-Inflation ratio during general anesthesia.,Rosa T; Menga LS; Mastropietro C; Settanni D; Russo A; Frassanito L; Cascarano L; Catarci S; Delle Cese L; Zanfini BA; Scaramuzzo G; Dell'Anna AM; Spadaro S; Antonelli M; Grieco DL,"BACKGROUND: During general anesthesia, the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on lung injury depends on the potential for lung recruitment, which is variable among patients. The recruitment-to-inflation ratio (R/I) is measured from ventilator data during a single-breath PEEP-release maneuver, and has been proposed to assess recruitability without the need for additional equipment during acute respiratory distress syndrome. This study hypothesized that R/I reliably estimates the individual potential for lung recruitment during general anesthesia. METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing open abdominal surgery received mechanical ventilation with PEEP=12 cmH 2 O for thirty minutes, which was then abruptly reduced to 2 cmH 2 O. Finally, a decremental PEEP trial was performed to measure collapse and overdistension at each level. Gas exchange, end-tidal CO 2 , respiratory mechanics by ventilator waveform analysis, regional overdistension and collapse by electrical impedance tomography, end-expiratory lung volume and functional residual capacity by nitrogen dilution were measured. R/I was calculated during the single-breath derecruitment maneuver from ventilator data. RESULTS: R/I (median=0.41, range=0-0.86) was linearly correlated with recruited volume normalized to functional residual capacity measured by gas dilution (r=0.48, slope=0.27 [0.03, 0.52]), and recruited volume scaled to PEEP-induced inflation volume measured by tomography (r=0.82, slope=1.2 [0.77, 1.64]). Compared to patients with R/I</=0.40 (n=10), those with R/I>0.40 (n=10) required higher PEEP to optimize regional mechanics and balance collapse and overdistension (median [Q1, Q3]: 10 [8, 11] cmH 2 O vs. 8 [7, 9], p=0.03), showed decreases in dead space (-2 [-5, 1] % vs. 3 [0, 5] %, p=0.013) and greater reductions in collapse (-44 [-31, -47] % vs. -30 [-20, -38] % , p=0.016) and dynamic lung strain (-0.06 [-0.09, -0.05] vs. -0.04 [-0.05, -0.02], p=0.04) with higher PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: During general anesthesia, R/I reflects potential for lung recruitment. R/I may help identify patients in whom higher PEEP improves physiology and may favor less injurious ventilation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40690301/,2025 Jul 21,2025-07-21,2025,2025-07

The erector spinae plane, pericapsular nerve group and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks offer motor-sparing analgesia of the hip region but target different areas. We designed this study to compare the pericapsular nerve group block combined with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block with the erector spinae plane block in terms of postoperative analgesia and motor impairment. METHODS: Our study involved patients undergoing primary elective unilateral total hip arthroplasty. All patients received spinal anaesthesia and standardised peri-operative multimodal analgesia. Patients were assigned at random to either pericapsular nerve group and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks ('anterior' block group) or erector spinae plane block ('posterior' block group). The primary outcome was intravenous morphine consumption within the first 24 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included: pain scores; assessment of sensory and motor block; incidence of complications; and incidence of chronic postsurgical pain. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients completed the study. The study groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. There was no difference in morphine consumption at 24 h between patients allocated to the anterior and posterior block groups (median (IQR [range]) 5 (1-10 [0-22]) mg vs. 5 (2-8.5 [0-20]) mg, respectively; p > 0.99). Incidence of motor block was 1/31 for patients allocated to the anterior block group compared with 5/31 for those allocated to the posterior block group (p = 0.09). There were no differences in any of the secondary outcome measures between groups. DISCUSSION: We found no statistically or clinically relevant difference between two motor-sparing peripheral regional analgesic techniques among patients undergoing primary elective total hip arthroplasty with multimodal analgesia.

40489632,Anesthesiology,Clinical and Genetic Factors Associated with Intraoperative Minimum Alveolar Concentration Ratio: A Single-center Retrospective Cohort and Genome-wide Association Study.,Douville NJ; Jewell ES; Zhao X; Colquhoun DA; Bertucci-Richter E; Zollner S; Davis RP; Kumar SS; Mashour GA,"BACKGROUND: Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is a standard dosing metric for general anesthesia. Although influences of MAC have been identified in controlled studies, the determinants of clinical delivery of MAC ratio are largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, the authors performed this single-center retrospective study. The primary objective was to understand factors associated with MAC ratio, as indexed by the end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration, for a given case. It was hypothesized that mean arterial pressure (MAP) was strongly associated with anesthetic delivery; a secondary objective was to perform a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with MAC ratio in clinical practice. METHODS: The primary outcome was mean age-adjusted MAC ratio during the maintenance phase of anesthesia. The primary exposure variable was mean MAP during the same time window. The correlation between the outcome, exposure, and a variety of demographic, laboratory, procedural, and anesthetic covariates was assessed in adjusted multivariable linear regressions. Next, the authors performed two genome-wide association studies of clinically delivered MAC ratio. RESULTS: Of the 30,125 cases included in the final dataset, mean +/- SD age-adjusted MAC ratio was 1.066 +/- 0.173, and mean MAP was 82 +/- 10 mmHg. MAP was associated with MAC ratio in the overall model (beta = 0.0028; 95% CI, 0.0024 to 0.0032; P < 0.0001). A variety of demographic ( e.g. , female sex: beta = -0.0182; 95% CI, -0.0219 to -0.0144; P < 0.0001), laboratory, surgical, and anesthetic factors were also associated with anesthetic agent concentration. Eight variants located near six genes ( DPH6 , CPM , EEFSEC , SGSM1 , CDH9 , and DISC1 ) reached the lower suggestive threshold ( P < 1 x 10 -6 ) in one but not both models; none exceed the threshold for genome-wide significance ( P < 5 x 10 -8 ). CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was verified that MAP was associated with clinical delivery of MAC ratio. The authors also characterized practice patterns of inhalational anesthetic management and identified numerous covariates that need to be accounted for when modeling anesthetic requirements. Female patients received lower doses of anesthetic, despite evidence that they have a higher requirement. While genome-wide association studies failed to identify novel variants at the level of genome-wide significance ( P < 5 x 10 -8 ), multiple mechanistically plausible genes were suggested. Notably, the DISC1 gene has been shown to impact resting-state brain activations under general anesthesia with isoflurane and has been linked to abnormal sleep/wake patterns.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40489632/,2025 Jul 21,2025-07-21,2025,2025-07

The recent study by Yang and colleagues sheds considerable light on this by training and evaluating a deep learning prediction model with biased and unbiased data selections. Unbiased training data allowed an algorithm to learn modestly more than just current blood pressure and the bias significantly distorted and inflated the positive predictive value.

40728528,Pain,Autoreactive immunoglobulin G levels and Fc receptor gamma subunit upregulation drive mechanical allodynia after nerve constriction or crush injury.,Fiore NT; Willcox KF; Grieco AR; Dayani D; Zuberi YA; Heijnen CJ; Grace PM,"B cells contribute to the development of pain after sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) through binding of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to Fc gamma receptors (FcgammaRs) in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord. Yet the contribution of B cells to pain after different types of peripheral nerve injury is uncertain. Using male and female mice, we demonstrate a divergent role for B cell-IgG-FcgammaR signaling underlying mechanical allodynia between CCI, nerve crush (NC), spared nerve injury (SNI), and spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Depletion (monoclonal anti-CD20) or genetic deletion (muMT mice) of B cells prevented development of allodynia after NC and CCI, but not SNI or SNL. In apparent contradiction, circulating levels of autoreactive IgG and circulating immune complexes were increased in all models, although more prominent after NC and CCI. Passive transfer of IgG from SNI donor mice induced allodynia in CCI muMT recipient mice, demonstrating that IgG secreted after SNI is pronociceptive. To investigate why pronociceptive IgG did not contribute to mechanical allodynia after SNI, we evaluated the levels of the Fc receptor gamma subunit. Spared nerve injury or spinal nerve ligation did not increase gamma subunit levels in the DRG and spinal cord, whereas CCI and NC did, in agreement with B cell-dependent allodynia in these models. Together, the results suggest that traumatic peripheral nerve injury drives secretion of autoreactive IgG from B cells. However, levels of cognate FcgammaRs are increased after sciatic nerve constriction and crush, but not transection, nerve injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40728528/,2025 Jul 18,2025-07-18,2025,2025-07
40728519,Pain,A catheter-associated urinary tract infection mouse model to study bladder dysfunction and pain.,Schillebeeckx L; Caldwell A; Luyten K; Sliwinska M; Gevaert T; Everaerts W; Voets T,"Bladder pain and dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs), including catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTIs). Underlying mechanisms of chronic bladder pain and recurrent UTIs remain poorly understood, and good translational mice models are sparse. Here, we developed a female mouse suprapubic CAUTI model, and combined in vivo and ex vivo imaging techniques and behavioral assays to longitudinally evaluate the consequences for bladder function, inflammation, abdominal pain, bacterial colonization, and biofilm. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection animals, with an implanted suprapubic bladder catheter infected with the bioluminescent uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) UTI89-Lux strain, were compared with sham-operated mice (SHAM), mice with a sterile catheter (CACON), and mice infected via transurethral instillation (UTI). Compared to transient infections in UTI mice, CAUTI mice exhibited sustained bacterial infection during >2 weeks, which was associated with bacterial biofilm formation on the catheter inner surface. Compared to CACON mice, CAUTI mice showed a more pronounced increase in suprapubic sensitivity, which was sensitive to antibiotic treatment. Void spot assays and fluoroscopic volumetry further revealed a smaller bladder capacity in both CAUTI and CACON mice, but only in CAUTI mice this was associated with reduced voiding efficiency. This model successfully recapitulates clinically relevant symptoms of CAUTI in patients and demonstrates that sustained bacterial colonization of the catheter directly contributes to bladder hypersensitivity and voiding dysfunction. This novel in vivo research model may be instrumental in the search for new therapies aimed at disrupting biofilms and treatments of bladder-related pain, infections, and dysfunction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40728519/,2025 Jul 18,2025-07-18,2025,2025-07

40683805,British journal of anaesthesia,Response of the Conox quantitative electroencephalographic monitor to neuromuscular block in awake volunteers.,Schuller PJ; Pretorius JPG; Newbery KB,"BACKGROUND: The Conox monitor analyses the frontal EEG to generate two indices of anaesthetic effects: qCON, intended to indicate the level of consciousness, and qNOX, designed to reflect responsiveness to noxious stimuli. Two similar quantitative EEG devices, BIS and Entropy, have been shown to require muscle activity (EMG) to generate accurate index values in awake individuals. Without EMG, these devices produce misleadingly low values and incorrectly suggest sedation or anaesthesia despite the cortical EEG showing the subjects are awake. As EMG affects frequency bands used by Conox, it too could be incorporating muscle activity to generate high values in awake individuals. METHODS: We replayed EEGs recorded during awake paralysis to the Conox monitor via an electronic playback system to test whether it requires EMG to generate accurate values in awake subjects. RESULTS: Both qCON and qNOX decreased after neuromuscular block to values consistent with sedation or anaesthesia, despite subjects being fully awake. qCON decreased below 60 in 15 of 19 trials, and qNOX decreased below 60 in 11 of 19 trials. Overall, 42% of qCON values during paralysis were <60, the level supposedly indicating anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Conox requires muscle activity to generate accurate values in awake individuals. Consequently, it might be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs. Studies conducted without neuromuscular block can provide misleading guidance when applied to Conox use in paralysed patients. Clinicians should approach manufacturer guidelines with caution and not rely solely on index values to guide dosing of anaesthetic drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40683805/,2025 Jul 18,2025-07-18,2025,2025-07

However, corresponding electroencephalography (EEG) free of the cardioballistic and fMRI artifacts is essential for translating decoupling observations to clinical monitoring. OBJECTIVE: To describe artifact-corrected EEG changes corresponding to cortico-subcortical decoupling at LOC. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary-care hospital, data collection from June 2017 to January 2019. PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen healthy volunteers receiving a targeted propofol infusion. INTERVENTIONS: Frontal EEG was recorded synchronously with clinical signs and fMRI. Gradient artifact correction was based on iterative peak detection. Cardioballistic artifact correction was accomplished with a recently described algorithmic method based on peak detection combined with temporal constraints. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The qCON index and frontal EEG before and after decoupling at LOC. RESULTS: Algorithm-filtered EEG tracings were suitable for analysis in 16 subjects. Propofol-induced LOC was achieved at a median (IQR) target plasma concentration of 4.5 (3.91 to 4.61) mug/mL and an effect-site concentration of 4.0 (2.94 to 4.31) mug/mL. The qCON index remained over 80 before decoupling and gradually decreased to values below 60 afterwards. Frontal alpha band power increased significantly from a median of 0.07 (0.03 to 0.15) 30 s before decoupling to 0.48 (0.08 to 0.58) 30 s after decoupling (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cortico-subcortical decoupling related to propofol-induced LOC coincides with a gradual decrease in the qCON index and an increase in frontal alpha power.

40681389,British journal of anaesthesia,Development and validation of a predictive model for transfusion in major abdominal surgery: a multicentre retrospective study.,Sim JH; Oh AR; Kim S; Park YS; Ha S; Kim JU,"BACKGROUND: Blood products are limited resources and preoperative transfusion often relies on protocols or clinical experience rather than objective risk assessment. Thus a systematic and accurate prediction strategy is needed for efficient blood utilisation and timely administration. We developed and validated a nomogram to predict intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. METHODS: We developed a nomogram that integrates preoperative variables to predict intraoperative RBC transfusion in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery at a tertiary care hospital (2012-21). The model was externally validated with datasets from other tertiary hospitals and an open dataset. Variables were selected using least absolute shrinkage or selection operator logistic regression. Discriminative ability was assessed with C-statistic, and calibration plots were used to evaluate the agreement between predicted and observed outcomes. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 128 749 patients for model development and 71 590 and 3701 patients in two external validation sets, respectively. Intraoperative RBC transfusion occurred in 6.0% of patients in the development set, and in 4.5% and 7.3% of patients in the two validation sets, respectively. The nomogram incorporated seven preoperative variables including age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, European Society of Cardiology surgical risk, haemoglobin, concentration, platelet number, international normalised ratio, and albumin concentration. The nomogram showed good predictive ability with C-statistics of 0.857 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.852-0.861), 0.847 (95% CI: 0.840-0.854), and 0.848 (95% CI: 0.822-0.873) in the development and external validation sets, respectively, demonstrating good calibration across the predicted probability range. CONCLUSIONS: This nomogram, integrating seven preoperative variables, can effectively predict intraoperative transfusion in major abdominal surgery.

These experiences can lead to mental health challenges and affect clinicians' ability to provide care. However, the literature regarding specific factors of clinical events that cause emotional distress is limited, and their impact remains understudied. The objectives were to explore elements within anesthesiologists' practice environment contributing to distress associated with clinical events and elicit emotions and symptoms regarding clinical events that are distressing long-term. METHODS: Anesthesiology faculty members at an academic institution were invited to engage in 30-minute individual qualitative interviews. They were prompted to reflect on a clinical event that caused them lasting emotional distress. Questions were based on risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder, focusing on two time periods: during the event and after it. To maintain study rigor, a trustworthiness framework was used that emphasized four components: transferability, dependability, credibility, and confirmability. A thematic analysis approach with two coders followed, with an audit trail maintained throughout. RESULTS: Twenty anesthesiology faculty members representing nine anesthesiology subspecialties were interviewed. Risk factors leading to emotional distress represented three areas: the clinical event, context, and patient. Clinical-related risk factors included clinical errors, a physician's first time encountering a clinical scenario, lack of adequate clinical support, and unexpected outcomes. Contextual risk factors involved legal and professional repercussions, mistreatment by non-anesthesiology colleagues, personal stress, and unsupportive leadership. Patient-related risk factors included having developed a close relationship with the patient, a patient's similarity to the clinician or their loved ones, and young patient age. Participants described emotions such as sadness, guilt, shame, helplessness, and self-doubt, and physical symptoms of emotional stress, flashbacks, and intrusive thoughts. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesiologists experience profound and lasting emotional impacts from challenging clinical events. Future research should evaluate interventions to mitigate these impacts on anesthesiologists' mental health and career longevity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40674546/,2025 Jul 17,2025-07-17,2025,2025-07

We implemented a 24-hour remote continuous monitoring service for high-risk inpatients (HIVE) to allow monitoring in general wards. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HIVE service. METHODS: We compared scoliosis surgery patients admitted pre- and postimplementation of the HIVE service and applied multivariable regression to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was incremental cost per ICU hour avoided. RESULTS: We compared 155 patients admitted postimplementation to 133 admitted preimplementation. In the adjusted analysis, the post-HIVE implementation period avoided 27.1 hours in ICU and reduced overall health care costs by AU$2682 (US$2164) per patient, compared with preimplementation. There were no statistically significant differences in hospital length of stay (rate ratio [RR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-1.11; P = .785), emergency readmissions (odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.44-1.99; P = .854), or hospital-acquired complications (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.27-1.66; P = .393).

Whether this accounts for nonlaparoscopic surgery is not known. Additionally, the effect on clinical and patient-reported outcomes remains debated. In this study, the effect of deep NMB compared to moderate NMB during total hip arthroplasty (THA) on quality of recovery and postoperative inflammation is investigated. METHODS: This single-center randomized controlled blinded trial comprised 100 patients undergoing THA treated with deep NMB (posttetanic count 1-2) or moderate NMB (train-of-four 1-2). Continuous or bolus administration of rocuronium was used. The primary end point was quality of recovery on postoperative day 1 (POD1), measured by the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) questionnaire. The secondary end points were innate immune function and pain scores on POD1, measured by ex vivo production capacity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-1beta on whole blood stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and postoperative pain as rated by the numeric rating scale. RESULTS: There was no difference in QoR-40 score on POD1 (mean difference -4.1, 95% confidence interval -10.9 to 2.8, P = .241).

Previous studies suggest corticosteroids may affect sugammadex effectiveness, but data on methylprednisolone in paediatric patients is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether methylprednisolone administration at induction affects the reversal time of rocuronium by sugammadex. DESIGN: Single centre, double blinded, randomised controlled trial. SETTINGS: Turkish tertiary care centre from September 2024 to January 2025. STUDY POPULATION: Paediatric patients undergoing elective adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either methylprednisolone 1 mg kg-1 (group M) or a placebo (group C) with anaesthesia induction. Neuromuscular block was induced with rocuronium, monitored using acceleromyography and reversed with sugammadex 2 mg kg-1 at the end of surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEAURES: The primary outcome was the reversal time of rocuronium by sugammadex: time from sugammadex administration at train of four (TOF) count = 2 to a TOF ratio of >/=0.9 of baseline. Secondary outcomes included extubation time (time from sugammadex administration at TOF count = 2 to extubation), postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting scores, and incidence of adverse events (stridor, hoarseness, severe cough and desaturation). RESULTS: At 89 +/- 20.3 s, the reversal time of rocuronium by sugammadex was statistically significantly longer in group M compared with the 54.6 +/- 9.3 s of group C (P < 0.001). The mean with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference was 34.5 (27.3 to 41.6) s. The extubation time was also significantly prolonged in group M compared with group C: 426.8 +/- 134.4 vs. 331.3 +/- 129.0 s (P = 0.002) with a difference of 95.5 (95% CI, 36.8 to 154.2) s. No significant differences were observed in postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting scores, or frequency of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Although methylprednisolone administration resulted in a significantly prolonged reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block by sugammadex and subsequent delayed extubation, the clinical importance of this interaction is minor.

RESULTS: No differences were found in the rate of postoperative complications (80% in both groups, P = 0.968), most of which were mild, with a Comprehensive Complication Index of 21 and more than 70% with Clavien-Dindo grade I or II. Prehabilitated patients showed a significant improvement in endurance time assessed by a constant-work rate cycling exercise test: preintervention vs. postintervention (301 +/- 109 vs. 578 +/- 257 s, P = 0.001), and in 6-min walk test (6MWT) (487 +/- 77 vs. 504 +/- 74 min, P = 0.001). No patients experienced adverse events attributable to the intervention. A sub-analysis restricted to prehabilitated patients who showed a meaningful response to exercise assessed by the 6MWT (increase >/= 30 m) showed a reduction in the number and severity of postoperative complications, compared to nonresponders (1.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 2 +/- 2 complications per patient, P = 0.038); and the Comprehensive Complication Index (16 +/- 15 vs. 25 +/- 19, P = 0.044). CONCLUSION: A multimodal prehabilitation programme before elective cardiac surgery did not reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Nevertheless, when analysis was restricted to meaningful responders to intervention, a significant reduction in postoperative complications and their severity was observed.

40659442,Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,Optimal multimodal analgesia combinations to reduce pain and opioid use following non-cardiac surgery: an instrumental variable analysis.,Graham LA; Illarmo S; Wren SM; Mudumbai SC; Odden MC,"BACKGROUND: Multimodal analgesia (MMA) is a perioperative pain management strategy that targets various pain pathways, resulting in reduced postoperative pain and opioid use. Unfortunately, the optimal combinations of pain medications to use with perioperative MMA remain uncertain. Our goal was to estimate the treatment effect of MMA on postoperative pain and opioid use and identify optimal non-opioid medication combinations to enhance MMA benefits. METHODS: The study population includes all patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery with general anesthesia between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2022 at six geographically similar Veterans Health Administration hospitals. An instrumental variable (IV) analysis was conducted using the anesthesiologist as the instrument to emulate randomization to receiving specific pain medication combinations. Outcomes were self-reported pain and opioid use after surgery. RESULTS: Of the 23 238 procedures included in the study, 46.1% received MMA. MMA was more common in younger patients, females and those with a lower probability of mortality. With IV analysis, inpatients with MMA required 6.8 fewer oral morphine equivalents (OMEs, 95% CI -10.2, to -3.4) in the postoperative period, and outpatients with MMA reported postoperative pain scores that were, on average, 1.0 unit lower than patients who did not receive MMA (95% CI -1.6 to -0.4). Combinations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) plus dexamethasone or regional anesthesia resulted in the greatest reductions in postoperative opioid use (mean reduction -29.5 OMEs, 95% CI -36.9 to -19.5 and mean reduction -28.4 OMEs, 95% CI -40.1 to -16.8, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings further support existing evidence on the effectiveness of MMA in reducing postoperative pain and opioid use following non-cardiac surgery. Importantly, our study highlights that dexamethasone and NSAIDs, not acetaminophen, which is almost universally used in MMA regimens, resulted in the greatest reduction of postoperative pain and postoperative opioid use. This has significant implications for the continued use of NSAIDs and dexamethasone in MMA protocols and underscores the need for future studies exploring the independent effect of intravenous acetaminophen on postoperative pain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40659442/,2025 Jul 17,2025-07-17,2025,2025-07

METHODS: Following board approval, in 2020 the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA Pain Medicine) commissioned evidence-based guidelines for best practices for infection control. More than 80 research questions were developed and literature searches undertaken by assigned working groups comprising four to five members. Modified US Preventive Services Task Force criteria were used to determine levels of evidence and certainty. Using a modified Delphi method, >50% agreement was needed to accept a recommendation for author review, and >75% agreement for a recommendation to be accepted. The ASRA Pain Medicine Board of Directors reviewed and approved the final guidelines. RESULTS: After documenting the incidence and infectious complications associated with regional anesthesia and interventional pain procedures including implanted devices, we made recommendations regarding the role of the anesthesiologist and pain physician in infection control, preoperative patient risk factors and management, sterile technique, equipment use and maintenance, healthcare setting (office, hospital, operating room), surgical technique, postoperative risk reduction, and infection symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Consensus recommendations were based on risks associated with different settings and procedures, and keeping in mind each patient's unique characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations are intended to be multidisciplinary guidelines for clinical care and clinical decision-making in the regional anesthesia and chronic interventional pain practice. The issues addressed are constantly evolving, therefore, consistent updating will be required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39837579/,2025 Jul 17,2025-07-17,2025,2025-07

We evaluated the carbon footprint of inhalation anaesthesia at a US academic medical centre over time and determined the relative importance of institutional measures (removal of desflurane and limiting fresh gas flow [FGF] and nitrous oxide [N(2)O] use) to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO(2)e-emissions). METHODS: From 124 428 patients undergoing inhalational anaesthesia between 2014 and 2022, CO(2)e-emissions per patient were calculated from minute-by-minute recordings of inspiratory concentrations of sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, and N(2)O, as well as FGF data. Data were combined with the global warming potential for each gas. Interrupted time series analysis, adjusted for patient and procedural factors, was applied to assess the impact of gradual removal of desflurane from operating rooms in June 2018 and its complete elimination in January 2020. RESULTS: From June 2014 to June 2022, mean CO(2)e-emissions per patient decreased by 82.8% from an average of 83.1 (median, 23.6 [interquartile range, 10.1-107.8]) kg to 14.3 (median 8.5 [4.2-15.9]) kg. In adjusted analyses, restrictive use of desflurane (-1.53 kg per patient, 95% confidence interval, -1.88 to -1.18; P<0.001) and its subsequent elimination (additional -0.50 kg per patient, -0.80 to -0.19; P=0.002) reduced CO(2)e-emissions. Before the elimination, desflurane was the main contributor to CO(2)e-emissions (74% relative contribution). After the elimination, use of N(2)O (73%) and high FGF (>3.42 L min(-1), 4%) emerged as dominant predictors of CO(2)e-emissions. CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating desflurane led to a substantial reduction in anaesthesia-related CO(2)e-emissions of  approximately 900 metric tonnes annually. This study highlights the importance of volatile anaesthetic choice and factors including N(2)O use and fresh gas flow to minimise the carbon footprint of anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40675839/,2025 Jul 16,2025-07-16,2025,2025-07

Existing questionnaires often lack patient input on item generation, are too lengthy, or were developed in culturally distinct regions. This study aimed to determine patient-perceived high-quality anaesthesia care and develop a short, validated questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with peri-anaesthesia care in Switzerland. METHODS: The Swiss Perception of Quality in Anaesthesia questionnaire was developed and validated in two university hospitals in German-speaking Switzerland. A total of 245 patients identified and ranked 42 attributes of high-quality anaesthesia care, leading to the development of key themes using a six-stage thematic analysis. The final questionnaire was tested for reliability and validity with an additional 350 patients. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: communication during the pre-anaesthetic consultation, side-effects and adverse events, and the interpersonal and professional skills of the anaesthesia team. Test-retest reliability confirmed response consistency. Dimensionality analysis showed strong correlations between overall satisfaction and other item scores (0.68 and 0.74). A three-dimensional model demonstrated a very good fit: Tucker-Lewis Index of 0.977, comparative fit index of 0.985 (both range from 0 to 1; values closer to 1 indicate better fit), root mean squared error of approximation of 0.039 (values below 0.06 suggest good fit), and standardised root mean square residual of 0.04 (values below 0.08 suggest good fit). Average completion time was 146 s (sd 8 s). CONCLUSIONS: This study validated the Perception of Quality in Anaesthesia as a tool for assessing patient satisfaction in individuals receiving anaesthesia care in Switzerland.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40675836/,2025 Jul 16,2025-07-16,2025,2025-07

We have reported that STIM1 is expressed in nociceptors. However, its functional significance remains unclear. Here, we show that STIM1 plays an important role in sensing cold, chemical, and noxious mechanical stimuli in both male and female mice. We found that activation of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) triggers ER Ca2+ release, STIM1 translocation, and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Immunostaining and western blot results reveal that TRPA1 is expressed in the ER. In addition, STIM1 deficiency in the primary sensory neurons reduces cold-, allyl isothiocyanate (TRPA1 agonist)-, and bradykinin-induced Ca2+ entry and nociception. Moreover, intraplantar injection of thapsigargin, an ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, evokes nociception and increases pain hypersensitivity, which is significantly attenuated in STIM1 conditional knockout or L3/L4 dorsal root ganglia STIM1 knockdown mice. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that STIM1-mediated SOCE increases neuronal excitability and decreases potassium channel Kv4-mediated outward currents in small to medium-sized dorsal root ganglion neurons, which is abolished by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular receptor kinase pathway. Our findings demonstrate that STIM1 acts as a transducer of nociception and uncover a novel link between STIM1 and TRPA1ER. Our study also provides new insights into TRPA1-mediated nociception.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40668026/,2025 Jul 16,2025-07-16,2025,2025-07

This study investigates androgen receptor (AR) involvement in pain sensitivity and sex differences in pain perception. Mechanical pain thresholds were higher in normal male mice compared to gonadectomized (GDX) male and normal female mice, correlating with serum testosterone levels. In the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), AR was expressed in normal males but undetectable in GDX males and normal females. Androgen receptor overlapped with NeuN, a neuronal nuclei marker, indicating androgen signaling activation in sensory neurons. In male sensory neuron-selective AR conditional knockout (AR-cKO) mice, mechanical pain thresholds were significantly lower than in wild-type males, with the greatest AR depletion in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)+ neurons. Electrophysiological analyses revealed increased excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons in both GDX males and AR-cKO males. In female mice, administration of testosterone propionate or dihydrotestosterone significantly raised mechanical pain thresholds, accompanied by increased AR expression in the DRG. This effect was abolished in AR-cKO females, where AR depletion was most prominent in CGRP+ neurons, consistent with male findings. These results indicate that primary sensory neurons, particularly CGRP+ neurons, are critical targets of androgen in regulating mechanical pain sensitivity. Therefore, manipulating androgen signaling in sensory neurons may offer a promising approach to managing mechanical pain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40668025/,2025 Jul 16,2025-07-16,2025,2025-07
40668023,Pain,Neurophysiological encoding of aversive prediction errors.,Gopalakrishnan R; Sonneborn C; Baillet S; Machado AG; Wager TD; Roy M,"Aversive prediction error (PE) brain signals generated by unexpected pain or pain absence are crucial for learning to avoid future pain. Yet, the detailed neurophysiological origins of PE signaling remain unclear. In this study, we combined an instrumental pain avoidance task with computational modeling and magnetoencephalography to detect time-resolved activations underlying pain expectations and aversive PE signals in the human brain. The task entailed learning probabilistically changing cue-pain associations to avoid receiving a pain stimulus. We used an axiomatic approach to identify general aversive PE signals that encode the degree to which the outcome deviated from expectations. Our findings indicate that aversive PE signals are generated in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) by the midbrain/diencephalon, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex approximately 150 milliseconds after outcome delivery. Moreover, alpha oscillations in these regions also encoded pain expectations before the outcome. We speculate that this may facilitate the rapid generation of PEs by allowing outcome-related nociceptive activity to be integrated with ongoing predictive signals. Finally, decisions to avoid pain recruited alpha oscillations in the anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, suggesting their active engagement in comparing predicted action values. Overall, our data reveal the rapid neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the generation of aversive PEs and subsequent decision-making.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40668023/,2025 Jul 16,2025-07-16,2025,2025-07

40705695,Pain,Evaluating the efficacy of neurokinin-1 (substance P) receptor antagonist CP-99994 on facial grimacing and allodynia in mice postsurgery: a comparative study with known analgesics.,McCoy ES; Ryan DF; Park SK; Zylka MJ,"Neurokinin-1 (substance P) receptor (NK1R) antagonists failed to effectively treat pain in humans despite having antinociceptive properties in animals. Here, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of NK1R antagonist CP-99994 at reducing facial grimacing in white-coated CD-1 mice after laparotomy surgery when compared to the analgesics carprofen and buprenorphine. To enable this investigation, we developed a machine learning algorithm to automatically score facial grimacing in white-coated mice using the PainFace software platform. This algorithm detects 5 facial action units of the mouse grimace scale (MGS; orbitals, nose, ears, whiskers, cheeks) and assigns a facial grimace score (0-10) for each video frame analyzed. Carprofen and buprenorphine significantly reduced mean MGS scores and percentage of high grimace (MGS scores >/=5) frames for up to 4 hours postsurgery across multiple doses. In contrast, CP-99994 showed limited efficacy, with only the highest 30 mg/kg dose reducing grimacing at 2 hours. Likewise, principal component analysis of grimace data over time indicated that carprofen and buprenorphine were effective at reducing facial grimacing, whereas CP-99994 was not. However, both buprenorphine and CP-99994 reduced mechanical allodynia at the incision site. These findings reveal a dissociation between the effects of CP-99994 on a spontaneous pain measure (grimacing) and an evoked nociceptive response, whereas a known analgesic reduced both measures. Our study suggests that using facial grimacing to assess spontaneous pain alongside traditional nociceptive assays may better predict analgesic potential and possibly reduce risk of translational failures when selecting drug candidates for clinical advancement.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40705695/,2025 Jul 15,2025-07-15,2025,2025-07

It is frequently added to multimodal analgesic regimens during and after surgery to reduce opioid use while controlling pain effectively. There is little evidence to show its effectiveness in major surgery. METHODS: In this multicenter, double blinded, randomized controlled trial, adults undergoing major cardiac, thoracic or abdominal surgery were randomized to receive either gabapentin (600mg before surgery, 300mg twice daily for 2 days after surgery) or placebo. The primary outcome was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included acute and chronic pain, total opioid use, adverse health events and health related quality of life. Patients were followed up daily in-hospital until discharge and then at 4-weeks and 4 months after surgery. RESULTS: 1196 participants were randomized (500 underwent cardiac, 346 thoracic and 350 abdominal surgery); 596 were allocated to placebo and 600 were allocated to gabapentin. Median length of hospital stay was similar in the two groups (gabapentin 5.94 (IQR 4.08-8.04) days, placebo 6.15 (IQR 4.22 - 8.97) days; hazard ratio 1.07, 95%CI 0.95-1.20, p=0.26).

While various workplace safety risks for anesthesiologists have been documented, head injuries remain an underrecognized hazard. This study aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of head strikes among anesthesiologists and perioperative nurses, examine reporting practices, and identify potential preventive strategies. METHODS: In this mixed-methods, cross-sectional national study, a 22-question survey was distributed to U.S.-based anesthesiologists and perioperative nurses in February and March of 2024. The survey, developed by a multidisciplinary team, included multiple-choice and free-response questions. The primary outcome measure was whether the individual had experienced a head strike in an operating or procedural room in the prior 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included the number of head strikes; source, timing, and head location of the strike; the amount of time taken off from work; whether a safety report was filed; and free-text responses for contributing factors, suggested changes to reduce risk, and challenges in reporting injuries. Qualitative responses were coded by investigator pairs using two collectively developed codebooks with themes and subthemes emerging inductively. RESULTS: Of the 1,549 anesthesiologists (6.6% response rate) and 287 nurses (2.7% response rate), 1,441 (78.5%) reported at least one head strike in the preceding year. Common sources included monitors (73.4% of respondents), light heads (37.4%), and boom-mounted equipment (33.4%). Most (948, 65.8%) incidents occurred intraoperatively. Causes of head strikes were multifactorial, frequently a combination of equipment placement, clinician movement, and tasks occurring under time pressure. Only 69 (4.8%) filed a safety report following a head strike. Barriers to reporting included time constraints, perception of strikes as minor incidents, and fear of negative consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Head strikes are a common but underreported occupational hazard in perioperative and periprocedural settings. Multi-faceted interventions addressing equipment design, workspace organization, and reporting culture are needed to reduce such risks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40663557/,2025 Jul 14,2025-07-14,2025,2025-07

The NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine blocks central sensitization, but has a variable track-record for preventing postsurgical pain. Patient-level factors contribute to variability in pain and may serve as markers of differential efficacy of preventive effect. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal randomized controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of intraoperatively administered ketamine to decrease postoperative pain after breast surgery. Before surgery, patients reported demographic and medical information and completed validated pain and psychosocial questionnaires. A subset of patients also underwent quantitative sensory testing to assess baseline temporal summation of pain (central sensitization tendency). Analyses of Covariance, controlling for relevant pre- and peri-operative factors, examined treatment group (ketamine vs. saline) differences in 2-week postoperative pain outcomes. Exploratory moderation analysis explored whether the efficacy of ketamine differed based on patients' baseline temporal summation of pain. RESULTS: Of the sample of 225 patients, 113 received ketamine and 112 received placebo. The majority of patients underwent lumpectomy (53%), with 16% undergoing mastectomy and 30% mastectomy with reconstruction. There were no significant treatment group differences in pain severity or impact reported two weeks after surgery. However, moderation analysis revealed that among patients with higher baseline temporal summation of pain, ketamine was associated with lower pain severity and impact scores. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine was not associated with an analgesic benefit over placebo in the acute postoperative period, as measured using a variety of pain assessments. However, exploratory moderation analysis suggested that patients with evidence of a greater central sensitization at baseline may derive an analgesic effect of ketamine. These findings support future collection of baseline phenotypic patient characteristics related to relevant mechanisms in trials, to identify which patients may derive a larger benefit from analgesic interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40663518/,2025 Jul 14,2025-07-14,2025,2025-07
40654033,European journal of anaesthesiology,Post discharge digital health technology interventions in ambulatory surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Bentsen SB; Stjernberg M; Raeder J; Eide GE; Tvedt MN; Hegland PA,"BACKGROUND: Given the early discharge associated with ambulatory surgery, digital health interventions (DHIs) may be useful in out of hospital follow-up. However, there are no systematic reviews concerning the use of DHIs in this setting. OBJECTIVE: To identify and evaluate the effects of DHIs on, patient safety, patient experience, and efficiency in post discharge ambulatory surgery. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation were used. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched from inception to 9 October 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs); ambulatory surgical patients >/=18 years; post discharge digital health interventions, including but not limited to computer tablets, mobile applications, and smart phones. Control group interventions included post discharge follow-up by a general practitioner, office-based follow-up, telephone follow-up, or no intervention. RESULTS: Six RCTs, with a total of 1397 patients were included. The meta-analyses showed no significant effects of DHIs compared with control group interventions on average pain intensity during postoperative days one to three, standardised mean difference = -0.15 (95% CI, -0.66 to 0.35), P = 0.556, or on unplanned healthcare encounters up to six months postoperatively, relative risk = 0.98 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.05), P = 0.580. A review of individual articles showed that patients in the DHI groups reported significantly less impaired sleep, mood swings, stress, dizziness, headaches, sore mouth, constipation, and wound-related problems. Additionally, costs were lower, and patients reported improved functional status and well being compared with the control group. The risk of bias varied from low to moderate and the quality of evidence was low. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health interventions may reduce some symptoms and costs following discharge from ambulatory surgery, while improving quality of life. However, uncertainty remains due to the limited number of studies, some inconsistent results, and the low certainty of evidence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40654033/,2025 Jul 14,2025-07-14,2025,2025-07

40653956,Anaesthesia,Incidence of postoperative delirium and quality of recovery in older patients undergoing gastrectomy under general anaesthesia with remimazolam vs. propofol: a randomised non-inferiority study.,Sim JH; Kim KM; Lee U; Lee EK; Noh GJ; Choi BM,"INTRODUCTION: Due to its haemodynamic stability and rapid recovery from anaesthesia, remimazolam is an attractive hypnotic drug for general anaesthesia in older patients. However, remimazolam must show non-inferiority in terms of the incidence of delirium and quality of postoperative recovery to be used as an alternative to propofol for maintenance of general anaesthesia. METHODS: Patients aged >/= 65 y scheduled to undergo gastrectomy were randomly allocated to maintenance of general anaesthesia with a remimazolam infusion (remimazolam group) or propofol target-controlled infusion (propofol group) in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of delirium within 72 h of surgery (assessed using the confusion assessment method). Secondary outcomes included the quality of recovery at 24 h postoperatively (assessed using the translated Korean version of the 15-item Quality of Recovery questionnaire) and the incidence of postoperative nausea, retching and vomiting. RESULTS: Of 461 patients randomly allocated in the study, 432 were included in the analysis (216 in each group). The incidence of delirium was 17/216 (7.9%) in patients allocated to the remimazolam group and 17/216 (7.9%) in those allocated to the propofol group (unadjusted odds ratio 1.00, 95%CI 0.50-2.02, p = 1.000). Quality of recovery scores were also similar between groups at 24 h postoperatively (median (IQR [range]) 109 (102-115 [54-140]) vs. 109 (104-115 [70-137]) for the remimazolam and propofol groups, respectively (p = 0.627); unadjusted odds ratio -0.03, 95%CI -0.19-0.13). DISCUSSION: Remimazolam can be used as an alternative to propofol in older patients undergoing gastrectomy from the perspective of the incidence of postoperative delirium and quality of recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40653956/,2025 Jul 14,2025-07-14,2025,2025-07

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anaesthetic effect of a laparoscopically-guided rectus sheath block on postoperative pain. METHODS: Within this prospective, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial, patients planned for inguinal hernia repair using the transabdominal preperitoneal patch plastic were recruited. Patients were assigned randomly to either a control group or an intervention group. Both received standardised pre-emptive anaesthesia during the surgical procedure with self-fixating mesh. In the intervention group, an intra-operatively implemented rectus sheath block was performed for postoperative pain control. The primary outcome was the postoperative pain score 3 h after surgery. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included in the study; 17 patients were randomised to the intervention group and 18 to the control group. Patient demographics and procedural times were similar in both groups. Postoperative median (IQR [range]) pain scores were not significantly different between the groups 3 h after surgery (intervention group 3.0 (3.0-5.0 [1.0-8.0]) vs. control group 3.5 (2.25-4.75 [1.0-8.0]); p = 0.854). The median (IQR [range]) oxycodone requirement after surgery was not different between the groups (intervention group 0 (0-3 [0-7]) mg vs. control group 0 (0-3 [0-7]) mg; p = 0.869). DISCUSSION: This study has shown that a laparoscopic rectus sheath block has no beneficial effect in postoperative pain management following laparoscopic transabdominal inguinal hernia repair.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40653913/,2025 Jul 14,2025-07-14,2025,2025-07

40659443,Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,To trial or not to trial before peripheral nerve stimulation for chronic pain: a retrospective multicenter comparative analysis of temporary-to-permanent and direct-to-permanent implantation approaches.,D'Souza RS; Yu Y; Singh V; Karri J; Javed S; Her YF; Chai N; Hoffmann C; Warner DO; Hussain N,"BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is an emerging neuromodulation therapy for chronic pain, yet its use in clinical practice varies significantly. Although temporary PNS is widely incorporated, either as a screening trial or a treatment itself, the evidence supporting the use of temporary PNS prior to permanent implantation is limited. We aimed to compare pain relief, opioid consumption, and adverse events between an approach implementing temporary PNS before permanent implantation (temporary-to-permanent (TTP)) vs proceeding directly to permanent PNS implantation (direct-to-permanent (DTP)). METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was undertaken at seven major academic institutions from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2024. Adult patients who underwent permanent PNS implantation for the treatment of chronic pain conditions were included and were divided into TTP or DTP cohorts based on their clinical approach. The dual primary outcomes were pain relief and opioid consumption (in oral morphine equivalents) at 6 months compared with baseline before any PNS therapy. Multivariable Tobit regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of pain relief at 6 months using a stepwise approach. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were analyzed (54 in TTP approach, 76 in DTP approach). Patient-reported percentage pain relief was 56.7%+/-27.9% at 6 months compared with baseline (before PNS implantation) in the TTP cohort, and 45.1%+/-33.6% in the DTP cohort. The estimated mean percentage pain relief at 6 months was similar in the TTP and DTP cohorts (between-group difference 15.24%; 95% CI -0.32 to 30.80, p=0.052), with consistent findings after sensitivity analysis with multiple imputation. Opioid consumption declined similarly in the TTP (-3.1+/-9.9 mg) and DTP (-2.1+/-8.1 mg) cohorts at 6 months with no statistical difference between cohorts (mean between-group difference: -1.00, 95% CI -4.57 to 2.57, p=0.580), and with consistent findings after sensitivity analysis. Device explantation rates and adverse event profiles were comparable between cohorts. CONCLUSION: Although temporary PNS is widely performed prior to permanent PNS implantation, there was no evidence that the TTP approach is associated with superior analgesic outcomes compared with the DTP approach. Further, patients in both approaches achieved clinically meaningful pain relief at 6 months compared with baseline status prior to PNS therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40659443/,2025 Jul 13,2025-07-13,2025,2025-07
